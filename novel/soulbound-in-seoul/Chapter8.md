### Chapter 8 -- **Signal: LOST**

The raid didn't wipe.

Not cleanly.

Not dramatically.

It bled.

It bled people, stamina, trust--until "victory" stopped being a goal and became a delusion nobody could afford.

The Adjudicator's HP bar hovered at a cruel fraction--still thick, still flashing **LVL 5**, still swinging chains that carved neon warning lines across the floor like the world was writing *NO* in light.

Jaxon screamed orders until his voice cracked.

"Healers--MIDLINE! TANK ROTATION! STOP PANICKING!"

But panic had already infected the formation. Once fear found a seam, it split everything open.

Someone ran for the Gate Core, convinced they could brute-force it.

They died.

Not instantly. Not cleanly. They collapsed under a verdict blast and didn't get back up, their nameplate dimming like a light switched off.

A wave of horror rippled through the raid--because death wasn't theoretical anymore.

The chamber filled with static screams and human ones.

And in the middle of it, Leon stared at Elizabeth like the floor had disappeared beneath his feet.

"Tell me," he had begged.

Joonseo had tried.

The system had silenced him.

Now his voice was back, but every word felt like stepping onto thin ice with the FRAUD debuff waiting beneath it--ready to crack, ready to punish.

Kairos watched them both like he'd found the most entertaining side quest in the apocalypse.

And the boss didn't care.

The boss raised its chains again.

A new banner tore across the air:

**PHASE 3: BLACKOUT**
**MECHANIC:** LIGHT DRAIN / COMMUNICATION LOSS
**NOTE:** PARTY LINKS MAY DESYNC

The chamber lights flickered once.

Twice.

Then went out.

Not fully--there was still neon, still UI glow--but the *structure* of light collapsed. The world turned into silhouettes and floating markers. People became nameplates over shadows. Monsters became aggro bars with teeth.

Joonseo's mini-map died completely, replaced by a single blinking message:

**SIGNAL: LOST**

The gold tether between him and Leon pulsed hard--then jittered, as if trying to hold connection through interference.

Leon swore under his breath, a sound Joonseo had never heard from him in-game.

"Tanks," Leon barked, voice suddenly raw, commanding. "Close!"

It wasn't Jaxon giving the order.

It was Leon.

Because when systems failed, instinct took over--and Leon's instinct had always been: protect the party.

Joonseo's stomach twisted at the irony.

Leon didn't trust him anymore.

But Leon still moved to shield Elizabeth like it was a reflex carved into his bones.

A verdict marker flared again--this time under multiple players.

The Adjudicator's screens flashed error codes like curses.

Joonseo raised his hands and tried to cast Illusion Veil to cover the retreat--

The spell stuttered, but didn't fracture. His earlier Trust Link reward--minor debuff resistance--held the mana together by a thin thread.

The veil bloomed in ragged gold and bent the darkness just enough to confuse the nearest husks.

Leon's barrier slammed down like a door closing.

"MOVE!" Leon shouted.

The raid surged backward in a broken wave.

Joonseo ran with them, cloak whipping, breath tearing, heart slamming.

He didn't know where the exit was anymore--Signal Loss had wiped directional markers--but the crowd moved as if pulled by instinct toward the entry point.

People screamed. Someone fell. Someone dragged them up. Someone got hit and kept running anyway.

Leon stayed beside Joonseo, shoulder nearly brushing his, shield flaring every time a husk tried to slip through.

Once, in the darkness, Leon's hand caught Joonseo's wrist--not a gentle offer, a *grip*.

It was instinctive. Emergency.

Joonseo's breath hitched.

The bond tether flashed.

**BOND EFFECT:** Calm (2 seconds) -- Overridden by Combat Stress

There was no comfort this time. Only the sharp awareness of being held in place by someone who might hate him.

Leon released almost immediately, like he realized what he'd done.

"Stay close," Leon said, voice strained. Not please. Not gentle.

A command.

Joonseo swallowed hard and obeyed anyway.

They burst through the raid's entry corridor and into the gate's threshold, a shimmering tear that had brought them in.

The system chimed--cold and unkind.

**RAID RETREAT INITIATED**
**PENALTY:** EXP LOSS (Minor) / Morale Debuff (Temporary)
**NOTE:** GATE CORE UNSTABLE -- MAY REOPEN

The Neon Abyss spat them out.

Gangnam's hub dome was still there--bright, warm, cruelly normal compared to the dungeon void. The moment they crossed into the safe zone, weapons dimmed slightly, hostility flags dropped, and some of the survivors collapsed like puppets with cut strings.

People vomited. People sobbed. People stared blankly at their hands as if verifying they were still attached.

Jaxon slammed his fist into the air and cursed loudly, voice shaking with rage and humiliation.

"We were close!" he shouted. "We were so close!"

Nobody answered him.

Because close didn't matter when bodies hit the floor.

And because everyone could feel it: the raid hadn't failed from numbers alone.

It had failed from fracture.

And fracture had a name now.

Elizabeth.

Joonseo felt eyes on him before he even turned.

The safe zone had rules. No PK. No hostiles.

But rules didn't stop hatred.

Or curiosity.

Or the kind of hunger people had for scandal when life became unbearable.

He pulled his cap lower and tried to move away from the crowd.

Leon stepped in front of him.

Not shielding now.

Blocking.

His posture was tight, face pale, jaw clenched so hard a muscle jumped near his cheek.

For a heartbeat, Joonseo thought Leon might yell.

Or hit him.

Or spit his name like poison.

Instead, Leon's voice came out low, shaking.

"Tell me the truth," Leon said.

Joonseo's throat closed.

The FRAUD debuff flickered, a faint red shimmer at the edge of his vision like a predator sensing blood.

Kairos appeared at Leon's shoulder like a devil who'd been invited.

He looked unhurt--of course he did. He'd been flanking, staying safe, saving his HP like it was still a game.

His grin was sharp enough to cut.

"Aw," Kairos said, tone sweet. "Look at this. Romantic."

Leon ignored him, gaze locked on Joonseo.

"Are you--" Leon's breath stuttered. He swallowed hard, voice cracking. "Are you… real?"

The question was so simple it hurt.

Real.

As if the core of Leon's love wasn't just gender, or attraction, or the face he'd adored in pixels.

It was the fear that everything he'd clung to had been a hallucination.

Joonseo tried to speak.

His mouth opened--

--and the system interrupted like a god slamming a door.

A window exploded into existence in front of his eyes, huge, bright, impossible to ignore.

**QUEST TRIGGERED: THE TRUTH WEIGHT (ACTIVE)**
**OBJECTIVE:** Confess Identity to Party Member (Leon)
**CONDITION:** Must be Spoken Aloud
**WARNING:** Refusal Will Escalate FRAUD

His blood went cold.

Leon saw Joonseo's face change, saw the way his eyes flicked like he was reading something.

"What is it?" Leon demanded.

Joonseo's hands trembled. His voice stuck.

Kairos leaned in, delighted. "Oh? The system's forcing you? That's cute."

Leon's gaze snapped to Kairos, fury flaring. "Shut up."

Kairos held up his hands with mock innocence. "Hey, I'm not the one who--"

Leon stepped forward one sharp step, and Kairos actually shut his mouth, grin fading just slightly. Leon's anger wasn't theatrical. It was real enough to scare even predators.

Leon turned back to Joonseo, eyes glassy.

"Tell me," he said again. Softer now. Not command. Not plea.

Beg.

Joonseo's chest tightened until breathing hurt.

He wanted to delay. He wanted to run. He wanted to find a loophole.

But the quest window hovered like an execution order.

And the FRAUD debuff pulsed, hungry.

He swallowed hard.

"I--" Joonseo began.

His voice came out wrong--too high, too thin, because it belonged to Elizabeth's throat.

He hated that the truth would be spoken in the voice that had lied.

Leon's eyes searched his face, desperate.

Joonseo's vision blurred.

The world narrowed to Leon's expression: hope disintegrating in slow motion, still trying to hold shape.

Joonseo forced the words out like pulling glass from his mouth.

"My name is Joonseo," he said, voice shaking. "I'm… I was… a man."

For a heartbeat, nothing moved.

The safe zone noise seemed to drop out, like the world itself held its breath.

Then Leon flinched like he'd been struck.

His face drained of color.

"No," he whispered.

Kairos exhaled a laugh--small, satisfied.

Leon's gaze snapped to Kairos with a fury so sharp it could have killed. "You--"

Kairos shrugged. "You asked for truth."

Leon turned back to Joonseo, breath ragged. "So… Elizabeth…"

Joonseo swallowed hard, throat burning.

"Elizabeth was a character," he said. "I made her. I played her."

Leon stared at him like he couldn't make the words connect.

Then his expression contorted--pain and disgust and humiliation colliding.

"You--" Leon's voice broke. He pressed a hand to his chest like he couldn't breathe. "You tricked me."

Joonseo flinched.

The word tricked was too small for what he'd done.

"Yes," Joonseo whispered.

The FRAUD debuff flickered.

For the first time, it didn't spike.

It… settled.

Like a predator satisfied with the taste of truth.

A system chime rang, bright and cruelly cheerful.

**OBJECTIVE COMPLETE: CONFESSION SPOKEN**
**REWARD:** FRAUD Resistance Increased (Moderate)
**NEW QUEST:** ATONEMENT (Locked)
**NOTE:** Party Bond Under Review

Leon's eyes flashed to the air, as if he'd seen something too--maybe a bond status warning, maybe a party link glitch. His gaze snapped back to Joonseo with raw disbelief.

"You--" Leon swallowed hard. "You were laughing."

Joonseo's stomach twisted.

The memory hit him: headset on, friends laughing, him joking that guys were easy.

Shame burned in his throat.

"Sometimes," Joonseo admitted, voice hoarse. "Yes."

Leon's face contorted like he'd been slapped again.

"And that night," Leon whispered. "That night you… you told me to stay--"

His voice cracked on the word stay.

Joonseo's eyes stung.

"That was real," Joonseo said, desperate. "Not because Elizabeth was real, but because--because you were. You were hurting. I--"

Leon's laugh came out jagged, broken.

"Don't," he said, voice shaking. "Don't try to rewrite it."

Joonseo froze.

Leon's gaze burned into him, wet with fury and grief.

"I loved her," Leon whispered. "I loved Elizabeth. I built my life around… around that voice. That comfort. That--"

He swallowed, eyes shining.

"And you were a guy behind a screen."

Joonseo couldn't breathe.

Kairos shifted, as if bored now that the confession had happened. "Well," he said lightly, "now that that's over--"

Leon spun toward him. "Leave."

Kairos blinked. "What?"

Leon's voice dropped, lethal. "Go."

Kairos hesitated--then scoffed and stepped back, lifting his hands.

"Fine, fine. I'll let you two have your little breakdown." He glanced at Joonseo once, eyes sharp. "But you should know--people are going to talk. Elizabeth's famous. This won't stay quiet."

Then he melted into the crowd, disappearing behind other nameplates like a rumor given legs.

Leon's chest rose and fell too fast. He looked like he might vomit. His hands shook.

Joonseo stood frozen, heart pounding, waiting for whatever came next: a slap, a scream, a complete severing.

Leon's gaze flicked over Joonseo's face--Elizabeth's face--like it disgusted him now.

The disgust stabbed deeper than any monster claw.

Leon's voice came raw.

"So what are you now?" he whispered.

Joonseo's throat burned.

"I don't know," he admitted.

The honesty made his shoulders sag.

Leon stared at him for a long moment.

Then his expression shifted--not softening, but tightening into something controlled.

A decision.

Leon stepped back.

He raised his hand and opened his party menu--Joonseo could see it, the translucent window hovering near Leon's fingers.

**PARTY: ELIZABETH + LEON**
**OPTIONS:** Leave Party / Kick Member / Maintain

Joonseo's stomach dropped.

Kick member.

Maintain.

Leave.

Leon's thumb hovered.

Joonseo didn't beg. He couldn't. Pride and shame welded his mouth shut.

He waited for Leon to end it.

Leon's jaw clenched hard.

Then, slowly, Leon closed the menu without choosing.

Joonseo's breath caught.

Leon's eyes lifted, dark and wet, voice low.

"I hate you for this," Leon said. "Do you understand that?"

Joonseo flinched as if struck.

"Yes," he whispered.

Leon swallowed hard, throat bobbing.

"But," Leon continued, voice shaking, "if I kick you… if I leave you alone…"

His gaze flicked toward the edge of the safe zone dome, toward the streets where PKs waited and monsters roamed and people saw Elizabeth as loot.

Leon's mouth twisted.

"You'll die," he said, like it was an accusation and a confession at once.

Joonseo's chest tightened painfully.

Leon stared at him with fury that looked like grief wearing armor.

"So I'm not kicking you," Leon said, voice rough. "Not because you deserve me. Not because you deserve anything."

He swallowed hard, eyes shining.

"But because I… I can't--"

His voice broke. He looked away sharply, as if ashamed of the words he couldn't finish.

Then he looked back, jaw clenched again.

"Don't touch me," Leon said, voice sharp. "Don't call me Leon like you used to. Don't act like this is--"

He cut himself off, breath ragged.

"Just… stay alive," Leon whispered. "Until I decide what to do with you."

The words should have been cruel.

They were.

But they were also--

A tether.

A choice to keep the party intact, even with the bond under review.

Joonseo's throat tightened.

He nodded stiffly.

"Okay," Joonseo whispered.

A system chime rang softly, almost private:

**BOND STATUS:** Unstable
**NOTE:** Continued Cooperation May Restore Resonance
**WARNING:** Betrayal Acts Will Trigger Severe Penalty

Betrayal acts.

As if the system had decided their relationship was a mechanic now.

Leon turned away from him, shoulders rigid, and walked toward a quieter corner of the hub safe zone, putting distance between them without breaking party range.

Joonseo followed at a careful distance, cap low, body trembling.

The crowd around them murmured--whispers rippling like insects.

"Did you hear?"
"Elizabeth is--"
"No way--"
"Leon looks like he's going to kill someone--"

Joonseo kept his eyes down.

His chest ached like bruised bone.

He had confessed.

He had shattered Leon.

And Leon--Leon had still chosen not to abandon him.

Not out of love.

Not anymore.

Out of something darker: a refusal to let anyone else hurt what had once saved him.

Joonseo's stomach churned with shame.

Because even now, even after the truth, he could feel it--faint, stubborn, humiliating:

His body still remembered Leon's hand.

His mind still remembered the night he'd told Leon to stay.

And somewhere under the grief and disgust, something dangerous flickered:

A fear that Leon leaving would destroy him.

And a fear that Leon staying would destroy him too--

just slower.
