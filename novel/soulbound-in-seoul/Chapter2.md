### Chapter 2 -- **Leon Found You**

The system's gold tether between them didn't feel like light.

It felt like a leash.

Joonseo--Elizabeth--kept his eyes on it as they moved. A thin line, pulsing faintly with each step, stretching from Leon's nameplate to his own. Every time he slowed, the tether tightened by a fraction, as if reminding him: *Party formed. Distance matters now.*

Leon walked ahead with the instinctive certainty of someone who had spent years reading maps that weren't maps. His head moved in quick, efficient sweeps--left, right, up. He tracked threats the way a seasoned player tracked patrol routes: not panicked, but alert, almost grimly calm.

It made Joonseo furious.

Not because Leon was competent.

Because Leon looked like he belonged in this world.

And Joonseo did not.

The cloak swayed around his thighs with each step, whispering against skin that felt too sensitive to air. He kept trying to adjust his posture, trying to walk the way he used to--long strides, shoulders squared--only to feel his balance betray him. Every movement reminded him of what had changed.

His body. His silhouette. The way strangers' eyes snapped to him, lingered, assessed.

He caught his reflection in a shop window and looked away so fast his neck ached.

Leon slowed at the corner of a narrow street lined with dark cafés and a closed photo booth. He lifted a hand--one finger raised--without turning around.

"Stop," he murmured.

Joonseo stopped instantly, heart climbing his throat. A second later, he heard it too: the skitter of something on concrete, the distant static-scream of a mob, and under it--

Human voices.

A group ahead, around a streetlamp. Three or four people. Their nameplates floated above them like hovering captions in a video.

They were arguing.

"No, I'm telling you, my inventory won't open--"

"Then how are you holding *that*?" another shouted, pointing at a glowing spear.

"Shut up--just shut up! I don't know!"

Leon watched them for a long moment, the way you watched strangers in the game when you weren't sure if they were friendly players or bait for a PK ambush.

Joonseo felt Leon's attention shift--subtle, like a pressure--toward him.

"Stay behind me," Leon said quietly. "And don't answer if they talk to you."

The command was gentle, but it carried weight. Like Leon expected to be obeyed.

Joonseo hated that it made him feel… contained. Safer. Smaller.

"Why?" he snapped, voice coming out sharper than he meant. It still startled him, hearing it--Elizabeth's tone, Elizabeth's pitch. Even his anger sounded different now, like it had been wrapped in velvet and sharpened into a blade.

Leon didn't flinch this time. He just kept watching the strangers.

"Because your character is… noticeable," he said, choosing his words with care.

Joonseo's cheeks heated instantly.

Not noticeable. Not *conspicuous.* He wanted to throw the words back, to spit something cruel. But the truth pressed too close to his skin: he *was* noticeable. He *felt* noticeable. He felt like a bright marker in a dark dungeon.

"What does that mean?" he forced out.

Leon finally glanced over his shoulder. Just once. But the look was enough to make Joonseo's stomach flip in an ugly, confusing way.

Leon's gaze wasn't predatory. It wasn't even lustful.

It was… stunned. Soft. Like he'd been holding an image in his head for years and the real version was too intense to look at directly.

Then Leon blinked hard and faced forward again.

"It means," he said, voice lower, "some people will see you and think you're loot."

Joonseo went cold.

A system window flickered into existence at the edge of his vision, like it had been waiting for that line to be said:

**WORLD TIP:**
**PLAYER KILLING ENABLED OUTSIDE SAFE ZONES**
**SOME PLAYERS MAY TARGET RARE APPEARANCES**

Joonseo's throat tightened until breathing hurt. He didn't want to admit he hadn't considered that part--how quickly the world's ugliness would adapt to game logic.

Leon started moving again, steering them away from the group, deeper into smaller streets. Joonseo followed, cloak trailing, heart thudding.

The gold tether pulsed between them.

He couldn't escape.

They turned a corner and the street opened into something familiar: a convenience store at the intersection, bright and square against the night. Its automatic doors were stuck half-open, as if someone had tried to flee through them and the world had frozen mid-motion. A flickering sign read **24시**--though now the numbers glitched, sometimes shifting into symbols Joonseo didn't recognize.

Most importantly--above the store, hovering like a halo--there was an icon.

A shield.

**SAFE ZONE**

Leon exhaled. Not relief exactly, but the kind of release you gave when your plan wasn't wrong.

"Here," he said. "We'll breathe here."

Joonseo stepped over the threshold and felt it immediately: a subtle warmth spreading through his skin, like entering a buff radius. The air inside the store was too bright, too clean, too normal. Shelves of ramen and snacks, the hum of refrigeration, a lone, abandoned basket near the register.

It should've been comforting.

Instead, it felt like a stage.

Because now they were alone.

Leon moved to the entrance first, testing the door with his hand, then stepping back as if he'd felt an invisible wall.

"Look," he said, pointing.

Joonseo followed his gaze. Just inside the threshold, a faint line shimmered on the floor--an arc of light like a boundary spell.

Leon picked up an empty bottle and flicked it toward the doorway.

The bottle hit the air and bounced back, clattering at their feet.

"Safe zone barrier," Leon said quietly, almost reverent. "It's real."

Joonseo stared at the bottle, at the invisible wall, at the fact that a convenience store had just become a sanctuary by system decree.

"So we're trapped," he said, bitter.

Leon shook his head. "Protected." He hesitated, then added, "Both can be true."

He turned and walked deeper into the store, toward the back where the staff-only door was. He pushed it open cautiously.

A storage room. Boxes. A narrow corridor that led to a tiny restroom. No monsters. No people.

Leon returned to the main aisle and looked at Joonseo as if he was waiting for permission to exist in the same space.

"Do you need…" Leon began, then stopped. His gaze flicked down--away from Joonseo's face, away from places he clearly did not want to stare at. "Do you need the toilet? Water? Anything?"

Joonseo gripped the strap of his bag hard enough that his knuckles whitened. He didn't know what he needed.

A reset button.

A logout.

A mirror that didn't show Elizabeth.

Instead, he heard himself say, "Stop… being like this."

Leon's brows drew together. "Like what?"

"Like you're…" Joonseo swallowed. "Like you're happy."

Leon's expression tightened. The softness in it didn't vanish, but something heavier surfaced underneath--something lived-in.

"I'm not happy," Leon said quietly. "I'm… relieved."

Joonseo's pulse jumped.

Relieved.

As if finding Elizabeth in real life was the payoff of years of longing.

Joonseo hated that longing. Hated what it implied. Hated the way it had been built--brick by brick--on messages he had typed as a joke, as a performance, as a manipulation he'd forgotten had consequences.

Leon stepped closer, stopping at a respectful distance.

"I thought I lost you," Leon said, voice rougher now. "When the sky… when everything happened, I thought--"

His throat bobbed. He looked down, jaw clenched, as if he was forcing himself not to spiral. Then he looked back up and the intensity in his eyes made Joonseo's breath stutter.

"In the game," Leon continued, "people vanish all the time. They stop logging in. They stop replying. They disappear. And you never know if they're okay."

Joonseo's chest constricted.

That last message--*I'm not doing well*--flashed behind his eyelids like a notification he couldn't swipe away.

Leon's voice lowered.

"But you," he said, "you always came back."

Joonseo almost laughed again.

Always came back.

Except when he didn't.

Except when he'd started ignoring Leon because it was inconvenient to feel responsible.

He opened his mouth--maybe to snap, maybe to tell Leon to stop--but a system window flickered into existence in front of him, forcing itself between him and Leon like an interruption.

**STATUS ALERT:**
**DEBUFF DETECTED -- FRAUD (Stage 1)**
**EFFECT:** Minor Mana Instability
**TRIGGER:** Dishonesty / Withheld Truth
**CURE:** Confession Questline (Locked)

Joonseo froze.

Leon's eyes narrowed slightly. "Did you… see something?"

Joonseo swallowed, throat suddenly too tight. The debuff window trembled faintly at the edges, like it had been etched into glass and his shaking was making it rattle.

He tried to close it.

His hand passed through it.

Of course it did.

He forced a calm tone he didn't feel. "Just… system junk."

Leon didn't look convinced. His gaze lingered on Joonseo's face, searching.

Joonseo felt his skin heat under that attention. Not arousal--no, not that--something closer to exposure. Like every lie he'd ever told was now visible on his body.

The debuff window faded slowly, but the word **FRAUD** remained burned into his mind.

He turned away from Leon abruptly and stalked down the aisle, grabbing at normal things just to have something to do. Bottled water. Protein bars. A packet of ramen he didn't want.

His hands shook as he piled them onto the counter.

He didn't realize he was breathing too hard until Leon spoke again--softly, from behind him.

"Elizabeth."

Joonseo stiffened.

"I--" Leon began, then stopped. "Sorry. I'll… I'll call you whatever you want."

Joonseo's fingers tightened around a bottle until plastic creaked.

He didn't know what he wanted.

He wanted Leon to stop looking at him like that.

He wanted Leon to stop saying Elizabeth like it was holy.

He wanted--god help him--someone to tell him what to do in a world where rules had replaced morality.

He forced out, "Don't call me that."

Leon nodded immediately. "Okay." He hesitated. "Then… what should I call you?"

Joonseo's mouth went dry.

His real name sat on his tongue like poison.

If he told Leon, the lie would crack.

If it cracked, Leon would see what he'd done.

And if Leon saw what he'd done…

The debuff window had said cure: confession questline.

Locked.

As if the system itself wanted him to suffer first.

"I don't know," Joonseo said finally, and hated how small it sounded.

Leon's shoulders relaxed a fraction, as if "I don't know" was at least something honest.

"Okay," Leon murmured. "We can figure it out. One step at a time."

Joonseo turned, and for a second he saw it clearly:

Leon wasn't trying to trap him.

Leon was trying to *build a shelter* around him with his own body.

That kind of devotion was terrifying.

It meant if Joonseo broke it, it would break Leon too.

Leon moved toward the back of the store, gathering items--bandages, a flashlight, anything that looked remotely useful. He was efficient, like he'd learned survival through games and now had to apply it in real life.

Joonseo watched him from the counter, arms wrapped around himself. The convenience store's fluorescent lights were too harsh; they made Elizabeth's hands look even paler, made the gold trim of her cloak gleam.

Leon glanced up once, caught him watching.

His expression softened again.

Not a smile.

Something quieter. Protective. Fond.

It made Joonseo's stomach flip in that same ugly way--because it wasn't just Leon's gaze.

It was the body's reaction to being seen as someone desirable, someone to care for, someone to want.

His old self had never been looked at this way.

Elizabeth had.

Joonseo hated that he could feel the difference.

Leon approached slowly, holding out a small packet--hand warmers.

"I don't know if the safe zone keeps temperature stable," Leon said, voice low. "But you're shivering."

"I'm not--" Joonseo started automatically.

Then he realized: he was.

His body was trembling, fine and constant, like a string pulled too tight.

Leon didn't push the hand warmers into his hands. He just offered them, palms open.

Joonseo stared at the packet for a long moment, pride warring with cold.

Finally, he snatched it.

His fingers brushed Leon's knuckles in the process.

Just a graze.

But the system reacted.

A soft chime echoed--too gentle for a world ending outside.

A faint gold pulse traveled along the tether between them.

**BOND EFFECT:** Party Proximity Stabilized
**MINOR BUFF:** Calm (10 seconds)

Joonseo's breath caught.

Not because of the window.

Because for ten seconds, the panic loosened its grip on his chest.

His muscles unclenched. His mind cleared just enough to make the relief feel like betrayal.

Leon's eyes widened slightly. He'd seen it too.

He whispered, almost to himself, "It… works."

Joonseo jerked his hand back as if he'd been burned. The Calm buff flickered out, and panic surged back in to fill the gap.

Leon's expression tightened, guilt flashing across his face like he thought he'd done something wrong.

"I'm sorry," Leon said quickly. "I didn't mean-- I won't--"

"Don't," Joonseo snapped, harsh enough that Leon fell silent instantly.

Joonseo pressed the hand warmers into his palms, not activating them yet. Just holding them because he didn't know what else to hold.

He stared at the floor, forcing his voice to steady. "We stay here until morning. That's it."

Leon nodded. "Okay."

He moved to the entrance, standing near the safe zone boundary, sword leaning against his shoulder. He looked like a guard posted outside a precious room.

Joonseo watched him for a long moment, anger fading into something he didn't want.

Leon stood there like it was natural to protect Elizabeth.

As if Elizabeth had always been someone worth protecting.

As if the lie had never existed.

Joonseo's throat tightened until it hurt.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Outside the glass, the world flickered with distant chaos--shadows moving wrong, system banners drifting like clouds.

Inside, there was only Leon's breathing and the soft pulse of the tether.

Minutes passed.

Joonseo tried to sit on the floor, but the skirt rode up in a way that made his skin crawl. He yanked it down awkwardly, cheeks burning, and hated how helpless the body made him feel. He hated that it changed the rules of his own dignity.

Leon didn't look.

Or maybe he forced himself not to.

Either way, the restraint was its own kind of intimacy.

Joonseo leaned back against the counter, knees tucked, arms wrapped around himself. He activated one hand warmer and hissed as warmth bloomed into his palms--too hot at first, then soothing.

Leon spoke without turning around, voice gentle as a lullaby.

"Can I ask you something?"

Joonseo didn't answer.

Leon continued anyway, careful. "When we were in the game… you used to sing during raids. Just… little voice lines. You'd hum into the mic sometimes when you thought nobody could hear."

Joonseo's stomach twisted.

"That wasn't me," he said automatically.

Silence.

Leon's shoulders lifted and fell with a slow breath.

"Okay," he said softly. "Then… whoever it was. That voice helped me."

Joonseo closed his eyes hard.

He could see it: Leon, alone in a dorm room in Korea, or a tiny rented space, headset on, voice quiet so nobody else heard. Hiding his loneliness behind a character named Leon, clinging to Elizabeth's warmth like it was the only gentle thing he had.

Joonseo had given him that warmth as a performance.

But Leon had received it as real.

That was the cruelty.

A system ping flickered at the edge of Joonseo's vision again:

**FRAUD (Stage 1): Mana Instability -- Increased Risk Under Emotional Stress**

He swallowed hard.

Leon turned his head slightly, just enough to glance back at him--eyes dark, searching.

"You're scared," Leon said quietly.

Joonseo's laugh came out brittle. "No shit."

Leon's mouth twitched--not amusement, but something like understanding.

"Me too," Leon admitted. "But… you don't have to be alone."

Joonseo's chest tightened in a way that was almost painful.

He wanted to say, *I made you lonely on purpose.*

He wanted to say, *You shouldn't want me.*

He wanted to say, *I'm not her.*

But instead, he heard himself whisper, "Why do you keep saying things like that?"

Leon hesitated, then answered with the simplest truth he had.

"Because it's what you said to me," Leon murmured.

Joonseo's eyes stung.

He pressed his face into his palm, trying to hide it, trying to hide everything.

Leon turned back to the door. He didn't come closer. He didn't touch.

He just stayed.

Minutes passed again. The fluorescent light felt harsher, then softer, as if his eyes were adjusting to the idea that the world wasn't going to reset.

Joonseo's body began to sag with exhaustion. His muscles ached. His throat felt raw from fear.

He didn't want to sleep. Sleep felt like surrender.

But he couldn't keep his eyes open.

His head dipped, then jerked up.

He caught Leon glancing back again.

Leon's voice came low, barely more than a breath. "You can sleep. I'll watch."

Something about the line--the simplicity of it--hit like a memory.

Leon had typed it once, long ago.

> *"You can sleep. I'll stay online."*

Joonseo hated himself for the way his chest softened around that phrase.

He wanted to believe it.

He wanted--god, he wanted--to let someone else carry the weight for a while.

His eyelids fluttered.

And in the moment before he lost the fight, he saw Leon's silhouette against the glass doors--broad, steady, sword at his side, guarding Elizabeth like she mattered.

Guarding a lie like it was a person.

Joonseo's last coherent thought, before sleep took him in the too-bright convenience store, was not panic.

It was worse.

It was the realization that Leon's devotion--born in the game, forged in that old darkness--might survive the truth.

And that if it did…

Joonseo didn't know if he'd be able to resist wanting it.
