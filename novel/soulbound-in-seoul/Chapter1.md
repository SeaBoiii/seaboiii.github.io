### Chapter 1 -- **Seoul Server: LIVE**

The first thing Joonseo noticed was the silence.

Not the absence of sound--Seoul never truly went quiet--but the way all the little noises stopped making sense. The laughter behind him in Hongdae, the clack of shoes on damp pavement, the tinny music leaking from a street performer's speaker--everything continued, yet the rhythm that stitched it into "normal" snapped like a cheap cable.

For half a breath, the city felt like a game that had buffered too long.

Joonseo stood under a strip of neon that read **노래방**, hands in his jacket pockets, shoulders hunched against the February bite. Night air sharpened the edges of everything: the smell of grilled meat drifting from a late-night pocha, the tang of cigarette smoke, the sweet chemical haze of perfume from a couple passing close enough for their coats to brush his. He was on his way back from a quick run--convenience store, two bottles of water, a packet of kimbap he hadn't really wanted but bought anyway because hunger was easier than thinking.

His phone buzzed.

A guild notification. Someone had posted a highlight clip.

He shouldn't have opened it. He knew that. His thumb moved anyway, on instinct, like the part of him that lived online and breathed in ping and ping and ping.

The screen showed **Eternal Dawn Online**, the game's glossy icon flaring for a second before the interface loaded. A familiar plaza--marble steps, fountain lit by moonlight, a skybox painted in a deep blue that always felt a little too romantic to be real. In the center of the clip, Elizabeth--his Elizabeth--stood in her white-and-gold Bard attire, hair a pale cascade, eyes bright enough to look like they had secrets.

A voice in the clip--someone's stream overlay--laughed.
"Bro, she's actually insane. Elizabeth carried the whole raid."

Joonseo snorted. He didn't mean to. It came out anyway.

A group of kids in front of him--university age, probably--were clustered around a phone, their faces lit blue by the screen. The game. Always the game. Most of Korea played it. Most of Singapore did too, and Japan, and Malaysia, and half the planet. It had become its own kind of language: dungeon clears, guild politics, memes that bled into real-life slang.

For Joonseo, it had been something else.

It had been a mask.

He thumbed the clip forward. Elizabeth stepped into a boss room, staff raised, an aura blooming around her like music made visible. The party's HP bars surged. The streamer screamed in joy. Someone in chat typed:

**ELIZABETH BEST GIRL**
**MARRY ME ELIZABETH**
**LEON WHERE YOU AT SHE'S CHEATING**

Joonseo paused.

That name. **Leon**.

His mouth curved without permission.

Leon had been a Singaporean player--always online at odd hours, always overly polite, always… earnest. So earnest it was almost embarrassing. He remembered the first time Leon had whispered Elizabeth in-game.

> *"Hi… sorry to bother you. I saw you help that party in the dungeon. You were kind."*

Kind.

It was funny. Not because kindness was funny, but because it had never been the point. Elizabeth was a character Joonseo had made in a bored, cynical phase of his life--a dare to himself, a game within the game.

"Let's see if they fall for it," he'd told his friends once, laughing into a headset. "Guys are so easy online."

He wasn't proud of that memory. Not really. But he also wasn't sorry--not in the way he should have been. It felt too distant. Like the kind of guilt you could file away and never open again as long as the world stayed normal and pixels stayed pixels.

Leon hadn't just fallen for it.

Leon had clung to it.

Joonseo's thumb hovered over his message history with Leon, a thread he hadn't opened in weeks. The last line still sat there like a candle left burning:

> **Leon:** *"Are you there? I… I'm not doing well."*
> **Leon:** *"It's stupid. Sorry. Just ignore."*

Joonseo swallowed, throat suddenly too dry. He told himself he'd been busy. He told himself Leon would be fine. He told himself, with the practiced cruelty of someone who didn't want to be responsible for another person's heart, that he hadn't asked to be anyone's lifeline.

He locked his phone and shoved it back into his pocket.

As if that would erase the feeling.

A gust of wind threaded through the street, carrying a handful of pink flyers and a discarded paper cup. The cup rolled, then stopped--stopped as if it had hit an invisible wall.

Joonseo frowned.

The cup wasn't touching anything.

It was hovering in midair, trembling.

Then it fell, clattering to the ground like a coin dropped by a nervous hand.

Above him, the neon sign flickered. Once. Twice. The light didn't just dim; it *glitched*, a hard cut from bright to black and back again, as if someone had toggled visibility in a settings menu.

His phone buzzed again--this time not a notification.

A long, low vibration like the device had become a tuning fork.

Around him, people slowed. Heads tilted upward. Conversations died mid-word.

Then the sky split.

Not with lightning. Not with some cinematic tear of clouds.

With text.

A translucent rectangle appeared overhead, stretching across the night like a banner nobody had asked for, its edges clean and perfect, its font too sharp to belong to the real world.

**SYSTEM NOTICE**
**PATCH 9.9: WORLD INTEGRATION UPDATE**
**WELCOME TO ETERNAL DAWN**

A girl screamed. A man laughed like it was a prank. Someone yelled, "What the hell is this?" in Korean. Someone else, in English, said, "No way. No way. No way."

Joonseo's blood went cold.

The banner flickered once--then shattered into dozens of smaller windows, floating like soap bubbles.

**QUEST RECEIVED: TUTORIAL -- SURVIVE THE FIRST NIGHT**
**CLASS AWAKENING IN PROGRESS**
**INVENTORY UNLOCKED**
**CHARACTER SYNC: 12%… 18%… 31%…**

"No," Joonseo whispered. It came out thin.

A woman beside him stared at her hands as her fingernails lengthened into glossy points. Her hair darkened, then flared a violent shade of red like a dye filter slamming into place. Her clothes shimmered, reweaving themselves into leather armor with metal accents. She screamed, not because she was hurt, but because she could feel her own body being rewritten.

The street performer's speaker exploded into blue sparks, then reassembled into something that looked like a crystal orb. The performer himself stumbled as a staff appeared in his grip, heavy enough to drag his shoulder down.

All around them: transformations. Some subtle, some monstrous. People collapsing, gagging, laughing, crying.

Joonseo's mind went blank for half a second.

Then it did what it always did when he was afraid.

It reached for logic.

This is mass hysteria. This is a prank. This is--

A window popped into existence in front of his face, close enough that he flinched back.

**CHARACTER SYNC DETECTED**
**PRIMARY AVATAR: ELIZABETH**
**ROLE: ENCHANTER / BARD**
**SYNC CONFIRMATION: YES / NO**

He stared at the words until his vision blurred.

"No," he said again, louder, as if volume could change the system's answer. His hand shot out to swipe the window away.

His fingers passed through it like mist.

The window didn't move. It simply hovered there, patient, like an NPC awaiting input.

Somewhere behind him, someone shouted, "Press no! Press no!"

Another voice--laughing, hysterical--yelled, "I can't! It won't let me!"

Joonseo tried to step back. His heel caught on the curb. He stumbled, bottles of water clinking in his bag.

**SYNC: 64%… 71%… 79%…**

His phone buzzed, this time with a harsh tone he'd never heard before.

A new notification, but not from any app.

From the system itself.

**WARNING: FAILURE TO CONFIRM WILL RESULT IN AUTOMATIC SYNC**

He turned, heart hammering, searching for something--anything--solid and real to anchor to. A café window. The reflection of his own face. A stranger's ordinary expression.

But even the reflections were wrong.

In the café glass, the man he knew--his own face--flickered like a corrupted file. For a heartbeat, his jawline softened. His eyes widened. His hair lengthened, pale strands spilling across his shoulders before snapping back again.

Joonseo's stomach lurched.

He stumbled toward the nearest alley like he could hide from the sky.

**SYNC: 88%… 92%… 96%…**

"No," he choked, voice breaking. "Stop."

He shoved into the alley, palm slapping brick damp with old rain. His breath came in sharp, humiliating bursts. His hands--his hands looked the same, but his wrists felt wrong, slimmer, bones lighter.

He looked down.

His fingers were trembling.

Not the shake of fear alone, but something deeper--like his nervous system was trying to map new territory and failing.

**SYNC COMPLETE: 100%**
**WELCOME, ELIZABETH.**

He didn't feel pain.

That was the strangest part.

There was no dramatic tearing of flesh, no cinematic agony.

There was only the sensation of… *sliding*.

Like he was a shirt being pulled over a different body.

Like the world had taken hold of his skin and gently, cruelly, peeled it into a new shape.

His chest tightened--then shifted. Weight settled where it had never been. His center of gravity moved forward. His hips… his hips--

He pressed a hand to his stomach, then lower, panic flooding him as the reality of it struck too fast to process.

His hand didn't land on a flat plane.

It landed on a softness that made his brain scream denial.

Joonseo's breath hitched into a sound that wasn't his, higher and sharper, dragged out of him like a confession.

"No. No--no."

He lurched forward and vomited into the alley, the taste bitter and hot. The air smelled of garbage and wet stone, and he hated it because it felt too real for something that couldn't be happening.

When he wiped his mouth, he saw his hand again.

Longer fingers. Paler skin. A faint shimmer of gold along his nails, like the game's cosmetic effect had fused to him.

He raised his hand to his face.

His cheek was softer. His jaw… narrower. His hair brushed his wrist--hair, long enough to tangle.

He turned his head slowly, dread like syrup in his veins, and stared into the reflective surface of a darkened window at the end of the alley.

A girl stared back.

Not a stranger. Not an NPC.

Elizabeth.

She had his eyes. He could see it--the same shape, the same small notch in the brow that always made him look like he was thinking too hard. But everything else was… her.

The face he'd designed like art. The mouth he'd shaped to look pretty when it smiled. The skin too smooth, the proportions too perfect, the kind of beauty that was almost unreal.

Except now it wasn't unreal.

Now it was the only thing he had.

The alley suddenly felt too small.

He spun, half-running back out into the street, as if he could undo it by returning to the place it happened. His bag thumped against his hip differently now, hitting a curve he'd never had before. His strides were wrong. His balance was wrong. The world tilted.

People screamed as monsters appeared at the edge of the street--low-level mobs crawling out of a shimmering crack in the pavement, their bodies made of shadow and neon polygons that didn't belong in reality.

A quest window flashed in front of him.

**TUTORIAL OBJECTIVE: FORM A PARTY**
**RECOMMENDED: 2+ PLAYERS**
**DANGER LEVEL: LOW (LIES)**

The parentheses chilled him.

(LIES.)

As if the system itself could laugh.

Joonseo backed away from the mobs, bumping into someone behind him. A man--no, not a man, a woman now, tall and muscular in heavy armor--shoved him aside with a snarl and charged forward.

The mob turned its head.

Its eyes locked onto Elizabeth.

A red bar appeared above it:

**AGGRO**

Joonseo's throat closed.

He turned and ran.

He didn't know where he was going, only that he couldn't stay where people could see him. Could see *her*. Could see what he'd become.

He darted down a side street, nearly colliding with a couple whose faces were twisted with panic. He pushed past them, breath tearing at his lungs, skirt--skirt?--fluttering around his thighs. He looked down and realized his clothes had changed too: a short white dress layered under a gold-trimmed cloak, boots that hugged his calves.

He felt ridiculous.

He felt exposed.

He felt--

His phone buzzed again.

Not a system alert.

A direct message.

His hand shook as he pulled it out.

The display was different now. A new icon glowed at the top of the screen, a stylized sunburst--the Eternal Dawn system interface embedded into reality.

A message popped up in a window that looked like the game's whisper chat.

**Leon:** *Elizabeth?*

Joonseo froze.

A second message appeared, almost immediately.

**Leon:** *Are you in Seoul? I saw the notice. I'm--*
**Leon:** *I'm here. I'm coming. Please don't log off.*

His chest tightened painfully.

Please don't log off.

A line Leon had typed so many times in the game--half-joking, half-begging. It had always annoyed Joonseo, because it sounded like need.

Now it sounded like fate sharpening a knife.

He stared at the message until his eyes burned.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard.

He could block him. He could pretend he didn't see it.

He could--

A new window appeared over the chat, forcing his gaze up.

**QUEST RECEIVED: REUNION**
**TARGET: LEON (NABIL RAHMAN)**
**DISTANCE: 0.8km**
**REWARD: SAFE ZONE COORDINATES**
**FAILURE: UNKNOWN**

Joonseo's breath went shallow.

The world had just turned into an RPG.

And it had given him a quest he didn't want.

He looked up, heart pounding, and scanned the street. Hongdae's familiar chaos had mutated into something else--people with glowing weapons, monsters at the edges, UI markers floating over heads, and on the corner… someone kneeling, sobbing, as if their body had betrayed them too.

Then he saw a figure on the far end of the road, running toward him with the kind of urgency that didn't belong to strangers.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. Hair dark and messy from the wind. His clothes looked half-normal, half-game: a hoodie beneath a piece of armor that glimmered like it had been yanked straight out of a character screen. A sword hilt jutted over his shoulder.

Above his head floated a nameplate:

**LEON**
**Level 1 -- Guardian**

Leon slowed when he spotted Elizabeth.

For a moment, his face went blank, like his brain couldn't hold the shape of his hope.

Then it cracked.

Relief flooded it so fast it looked like pain.

He stopped a few steps away, staring at her as if she might vanish if he blinked.

"Elizabeth," he said.

His voice had a Singaporean edge to it--English softened by the way he'd learned to speak in a country where languages mixed like rain. He sounded the same as he did on voice chat, and it hit Joonseo like a punch.

Leon's eyes were wet. He swallowed hard.

"I… I found you," he breathed, like it was a miracle. Like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

Joonseo's body reacted before his mind could catch up.

A sick wave rolled through him--disgust, fear, shame, and something far more dangerous: the memory of being wanted.

He took a step back.

Leon took a step forward.

"No," Joonseo snapped, the word coming out too sharp in a voice that wasn't his. "Don't--don't come closer."

Leon froze instantly, hands lifting in a nonthreatening gesture.

"Okay," he said quickly. "Okay. I won't. I just--"

His gaze flicked over her, taking in the cloak, the hair, the face he knew too well from the game and now… now it was real. The intensity of his stare made Joonseo feel naked.

Leon's throat bobbed.

"You're real," he whispered, like he'd been bracing his whole life for disappointment and the universe had--finally--been kind.

Joonseo almost laughed.

Not because it was funny.

Because it was horrifying.

He wanted to tell him the truth. He wanted to scream it into the street like an exorcism.

I'm not her. I never was. I was a guy behind a screen, laughing.

But the words stuck behind his teeth, thick and sour.

A mob screeched from the corner. The sound wasn't organic--it was like corrupted audio, too sharp, too high. Leon's head snapped toward it immediately.

A creature--level 1, low danger, according to the system--skittered into view, its body a jagged mix of shadow and neon. Its eyes locked onto Elizabeth again, aggro bar flaring red.

Leon moved without hesitation.

He stepped in front of her.

A translucent shield icon flashed above his head.

His stance widened. Protective. Practiced. Like he'd done it a thousand times online and his body remembered the role.

"Stay behind me," Leon said, voice steady now, the way it had always been in raids. "Okay? Just--trust me."

Joonseo's throat tightened.

Trust me.

Another phrase from the game.

Another thing Leon had always offered like it was simple.

The mob lunged.

Leon raised his arm. A pale barrier shimmered into existence, catching the creature midair. Sparks flew, blue and gold.

Joonseo stumbled backward, heart slamming, and his own UI flared:

**SKILL AVAILABLE: CHARM HYMN**
**SKILL AVAILABLE: COURAGE AURA**
**SKILL AVAILABLE: ILLUSION VEIL**

His hands shook as he lifted them, instinct fighting reluctance.

He didn't want to use Elizabeth's skills. It felt like admitting she existed.

But the creature slammed again, and Leon grunted as the barrier trembled.

"Elizabeth!" Leon snapped, urgent. "I need you--"

The desperation in his voice struck something sharp in Joonseo's chest.

Need.

Always need.

Joonseo swallowed and forced his voice out, thin and trembling.

"Stop calling me that," he hissed.

Leon flinched--but he didn't argue.

He just took the hit again, teeth clenched, trying to hold the line.

Joonseo's fingers curled.

He selected the skill by instinct.

A note--an actual musical note--shimmered into existence between his hands, golden and bright, and when he released it, it spread like warm light, washing over Leon.

His HP bar steadied. A buff icon appeared:

**COURAGE AURA -- ACTIVE**

Leon's shoulders loosened just a fraction, as if the magic had not only strengthened his body but steadied his heart.

The mob screeched, confused by the shift.

Leon drove his blade forward, and the creature burst into a spray of pixels that scattered into the air like dying fireflies.

Silence fell again--this time earned.

Leon stood still for a heartbeat, chest rising and falling, sword held low. Then he turned.

He looked at Elizabeth like she was the answer to something he'd been asking for too long.

"Thank you," he whispered.

Joonseo's stomach twisted.

He hated that his body warmed at the softness in Leon's voice. Hated that gratitude could feel like intimacy. Hated that the system's faint glow made Leon's face look even more real.

Leon took one cautious step closer.

"I won't push," he said quickly, like he could hear the panic in her breathing. "I just… I need to know you're safe. That's all."

Joonseo backed away again, heels hitting the curb.

"Why?" he demanded, voice cracking. "Why do you care so much?"

Leon blinked, stunned by the question--as if the answer was obvious.

Then his gaze softened in a way that made Joonseo's lungs forget how to work.

"Because you saved me," Leon said quietly.

The words landed like a spell.

Not the game's kind.

The human kind.

Joonseo's mouth went dry. He saw, in a flash, the chat window from months ago--the night Leon had typed too fast, too frantic, and Elizabeth had stayed online for hours, talking him down, telling him to drink water, to breathe, to promise.

Joonseo had done it.

Not because he'd wanted to be a hero.

But because something in Leon's words had sounded too close to falling.

And now, in this broken Seoul, Leon looked at her like that night had become a religion.

Joonseo's hands trembled.

A new system window slid into view, cruelly timed.

**PARTY INVITE RECEIVED: LEON**
**ACCEPT / DECLINE**
**NOTE: SOLO SURVIVAL RATE -- 13%**
**PARTY SURVIVAL RATE -- 62%**

Joonseo stared at the buttons.

Accept meant staying near Leon. Letting him cling. Letting him believe.

Decline meant being alone in a world that hunted characters like Elizabeth.

Leon didn't move. He didn't rush him. He waited, hands still open, face bruised by hope.

"I'm not asking you to… be anything," Leon said softly, voice careful. "Just--please. Let me protect you tonight."

Joonseo's breath shook.

The world around them crackled with distant screams, monster shrieks, the sound of a civilization trying to remember how to exist.

His finger hovered over **ACCEPT**.

His mind screamed no.

His body--this body--shivered, cold and scared and suddenly, horribly aware of how small it felt behind Leon's broad frame.

And somewhere under the panic, buried deep beneath shame, something else flickered:

A fear he didn't want to name.

That he might not survive alone.

That he might not survive *him*.

That he might not survive the way Leon looked at Elizabeth like she was salvation.

Joonseo pressed **ACCEPT**.

The system chimed.

A thin gold line flashed between them, connecting their nameplates like a tether.

**PARTY FORMED: ELIZABETH + LEON**
**NEW QUEST UNLOCKED: FIND SAFE ZONE**
**TIME LIMIT: 2 HOURS**

Leon exhaled like he'd been holding his breath since the sky split.

"Okay," he murmured. "Okay. We'll get somewhere safe."

He offered his hand--hesitant, not touching, just… there.

Joonseo stared at it like it was a trap.

Then, against every instinct he had, he stepped closer--not to take it, but to move behind him as another shriek echoed down the street.

Leon shifted immediately, placing his body between Elizabeth and the sound.

Protecting her without being asked.

As if it was his default state.

Joonseo's throat tightened again, and this time it wasn't only fear.

Because Leon's devotion had been born from a lie--

--but the night Elizabeth saved him had been real.

And now the world had made Elizabeth real too.

Somewhere in the distance, another system banner unfurled across the night sky like a prophecy.

**WELCOME TO ETERNAL DAWN.**

Joonseo swallowed hard, and followed Leon into the broken neon streets of Seoul.

Not knowing whether he was walking toward safety--

or toward consequence.
