### Chapter 5 -- **The Night Elizabeth Saved Leon**

The safe zone near Hongik University Station didn't feel like safety.

It felt like a crowd.

It was brighter than the convenience store--flooded in a warm, artificial glow that spilled out from the station entrance and the surrounding businesses like someone had plugged the district into a generator. A translucent dome shimmered faintly over the area, visible only when you looked at it from the right angle. People moved beneath it in clusters, their nameplates bobbing over heads like captions in a documentary nobody had agreed to star in.

**SAFE ZONE -- HUB REGISTERED**
**RULES:** No PK / No Hostiles / Rest Bonus Active

Joonseo saw the rule window flicker at the edge of his vision and felt his shoulders sag with a relief he hated.

No PK.

No hostiles.

Rest bonus.

The system wasn't kind, but it was consistent.

The dome kept monsters out. It did nothing about people.

Inside the safe zone, survival had already begun to look like society. A line of strangers sat along the station wall, trading items from their inventories. Someone with a healer icon over their nameplate offered basic cleanses in exchange for food. A group of armored players argued loudly about forming a guild--already talking like this was a season of content, not the end of the world.

A streamer-type--he could tell by the way the man stood in the center of the crowd like he was used to being watched--had a hovering banner above his head, bigger than a normal nameplate:

**SUNFALL GUILD RECRUITING -- JOIN FOR RAID PROTECTION**

People drifted toward it like moths.

Leon moved with purposeful calm, guiding Joonseo along the edge of the crowd where fewer eyes lingered. Still, Joonseo caught glances--quick, hungry looks from players who recognized Elizabeth and from strangers who didn't recognize her but understood what a beautiful female character meant in a world where everyone's avatar had become their body.

He pulled his cap lower and kept his gaze down.

It didn't stop the weight of being seen.

Leon paused near a convenience store entrance inside the safe zone--another one, lit and open, but now crowded with survivors rifling through shelves like a storm of hands.

"Here," Leon murmured, voice close. "We can regroup here. We can… plan."

Joonseo's jaw clenched. "Stop talking like this is normal."

Leon's eyes flicked to him--steady, tired. "It's not normal," he said quietly. "But it's happening. And planning keeps you alive."

You.

Always you.

Leon's devotion always angled toward Elizabeth like she was the center of his world. It made Joonseo's skin crawl with guilt and--worse--something like warmth.

He shoved the feeling down.

"We need supplies," Joonseo muttered, forcing practicality into his voice like armor. "Food. Water. Maybe… clothes."

The word clothes hit him like a slap. His outfit was ridiculous. Beautiful, yes, in a way he'd designed intentionally--white and gold, short skirt, tall boots, the kind of aesthetic that drew attention in-game.

In reality, it felt like walking around with a target painted on his thighs.

Leon nodded immediately. "Clothes. Yes. There might be gear drops too. Or… we can trade."

He hesitated, then asked with careful gentleness, "Do you want something less… noticeable?"

Joonseo's laugh came out brittle. "You mean less *female*?"

Leon's face tightened. "No." He shook his head quickly. "I mean less--" He searched for words, then said quietly, "Less exposed. More comfortable."

Comfortable.

The word made Joonseo's throat close.

There was no comfort. Not in this body. Not in this world.

Not with Leon looking at him like--

Joonseo turned away abruptly and walked into the store, pushing past a man who had become an elf-like ranger and a woman whose skin shimmered with a mage effect. He grabbed water, protein bars, anything compact and useful. His hands moved faster than his thoughts, as if keeping busy could keep panic from swallowing him whole.

Leon followed, keeping close enough that the party tether didn't tug too hard, but not close enough to crowd. He watched the door, watched the people, watched everything.

It annoyed Joonseo. It also… steadied him.

He hated that too.

At the counter, there was no cashier--only an NPC with the same too-perfect eyes as the hub lady, smiling as if apocalypse was customer service.

"Payment via inventory," it chirped.

Leon handed over items with smooth efficiency, trading tokens and basic loot he'd picked up from the tutorial gate. Joonseo watched him, irritated by how naturally Leon navigated this.

Of course he did.

Leon had always lived here.

And that thought cracked something loose in Joonseo's mind.

Because he remembered.

Not the Collision. Not the mobs.

Leon's messages.

The night Leon had said he wasn't doing well.

The night Elizabeth had saved him.

In the game.

Not in this new world.

That night had happened long before the sky split--when reality had still been something you could escape into pixels.

The memory came back with uncomfortable sharpness, like someone had just clicked replay.

--

It had been late.

Not Seoul late--*Singapore* late, if he was guessing right, because Leon used to log in at hours that made no sense unless he was on a different schedule or sleepless.

Elizabeth had been in the plaza--the same marble fountain, the same moonlit skybox. Joonseo had been half-distracted, idly enchanting gear, laughing with friends in voice chat. Someone had joked about "collecting simps," and Joonseo had laughed too, a bit too loudly.

Then Leon had whispered.

> **Leon:** *Elizabeth? Are you there?*

Joonseo had almost ignored it.

He'd been tired. He'd been in a mood. He'd been--god, he'd been selfish.

> **Leon:** *Sorry. If you're busy, it's okay.*
> **Leon:** *I just… I don't think I can do this anymore.*

That line had made Joonseo's fingers stop.

Not because it was dramatic. He'd seen plenty of dramatic messages online.

Because Leon didn't talk like that.

Leon always apologized. Leon always softened himself.

For Leon to say *I don't think I can do this anymore*--without emojis, without jokes--

It had felt like a hand reaching out of the screen.

Joonseo had muted his friends without explaining, turned down his mic, and whispered into the headset in Elizabeth's voice--his fake voice, his practiced softness.

> **Elizabeth:** *Leon. Talk to me.*
> **Elizabeth:** *Where are you? Are you alone?*

Leon's reply had come too fast, like he'd been waiting with shaking fingers.

> **Leon:** *Yeah.*
> **Leon:** *I'm alone.*
> **Leon:** *It's stupid. I'm sorry.*
> **Leon:** *People at work… and back home… I don't know. It feels like I'm always the joke.*

Work.

Back home.

Joonseo had pictured Singapore--bright, humid, crowded, and still somehow lonely.

> **Elizabeth:** *It's not stupid.*
> **Elizabeth:** *You're not a joke.*

Leon hadn't answered for a full minute.

Then:

> **Leon:** *I got bullied a lot. Like… even after school. I thought it would end, but it didn't. They found new ways.*
> **Leon:** *Sometimes I think if I disappear, nobody will care. I don't even know why I'm typing this.*

Joonseo had stared at those words until his eyes blurred.

He remembered the strange anger he'd felt then--not at Leon, but at the world that could make someone type that with trembling honesty.

He remembered the way his friends' laughter in voice chat suddenly sounded far away, childish.

And he remembered, most painfully, that Elizabeth--his fake persona--had been the only version of him that could be kind without being embarrassed.

So he had leaned into it.

He had told Leon, softly but firmly:

> **Elizabeth:** *Don't disappear tonight.*
> **Elizabeth:** *Do three things for me, okay?*
> **Elizabeth:** *Drink water.*
> **Elizabeth:** *Sit on the floor. Back against the wall.*
> **Elizabeth:** *And tell me one person you can message right now. Just to say you're not okay.*

Leon had replied:

> **Leon:** *Why are you…*
> **Leon:** *Why do you care?*

And Joonseo--behind the screen--had felt something twist, something too close to responsibility.

He'd typed the line that would haunt him later.

> **Elizabeth:** *Because you're here.*
> **Elizabeth:** *And I'm here too.*
> **Elizabeth:** *So stay. For tonight. Just stay.*

Leon had stayed.

Not just for that night.

For months after.

He'd started logging in just to hear Elizabeth's voice. Just to raid with her. Just to exist near her in the game world where nobody could touch him.

Where nobody could bully him.

Where he could be Leon instead of whatever name people used to taunt him with in real life.

Elizabeth had become his anchor.

And Joonseo had--what?

Smiled about it?

Joked about it?

Ignored it when it became inconvenient?

--

The memory faded, leaving Joonseo standing in a convenience store in real Seoul, hands full of supplies, stomach churning.

Leon was still talking to the NPC, finishing the trade.

Joonseo stared at Leon's profile--the shape of his jaw, the tired set of his shoulders, the way he moved like someone who'd learned to carry weight quietly.

Leon turned and caught him staring.

His expression softened instantly.

"Hey," Leon said gently. "You okay?"

The question hit Joonseo like a test he couldn't pass.

He felt the FRAUD debuff flicker, eager at the edge of his vision, sensing the lie forming.

He tried to answer with the first thing that came, automatic defense:

"I'm fine."

Pain lanced behind his eyes--sharp enough that he winced.

The FRAUD window flashed red:

**FRAUD (Stage 1) -- Dishonesty Spike**
**EFFECT:** Mana Instability + Emotional Overload (Minor)
**NOTE:** Truth Alignment Required for Advancement

Leon's eyes widened. He stepped closer instinctively.

Joonseo jerked back, palms up.

"Don't," he snapped, breath too fast. "Just--don't."

Leon froze, hands still.

His voice went low. "That… happens when you lie?"

Joonseo swallowed hard. His throat felt sandpapered raw.

He wanted to deny it. But denial would spike it again.

So he did the only thing he could do.

He nodded.

Leon's face tightened with concern--and something else. Understanding, maybe. Like Leon had always known Elizabeth had secrets. Like he'd always accepted that she did.

"Okay," Leon said softly. "Then… don't lie. Not to me. Not to yourself."

The words hit in a way that made Joonseo's chest ache.

Not to me.

Leon still assumed Elizabeth was Elizabeth. Still believed the persona.

And Joonseo--the real Joonseo--was trapped behind the face he'd invented.

He clenched his jaw so hard it hurt.

"Let's go," Joonseo muttered, forcing movement to keep emotion from rising. "We've got supplies."

Leon nodded and followed him out.

They moved through the safe zone crowd again, angling toward the station's interior where a large resting area had formed--people sitting on the floor, leaning against walls, some sleeping with weapons in their laps. An unspoken rule had formed: stay together, watch each other, don't wander.

A woman with a healer icon offered Leon a cleanse for a ration.

Leon declined.

A guild recruiter called out to them, eyes widening when he saw Elizabeth.

"Hey--Elizabeth! Join Sunfall! We can protect you--"

Leon's posture sharpened. He stepped in front of Joonseo instantly, blocking the recruiter's view like a shield.

"No," Leon said flatly.

The recruiter blinked, then scoffed. "You think you can survive alone?"

Leon's gaze didn't waver. "Yes."

They kept walking.

Joonseo's stomach twisted again at the word protect.

Everyone wanted to protect Elizabeth.

Or own her.

Or use her.

He hated it all.

They found a corner inside the station--near a closed shopfront--where the dome's glow was still visible through the glass. It was quieter there. Less traffic. Less eyes.

Leon sat with his back to the wall, sword across his lap, posture angled outward like a guard. Joonseo sat a short distance away, close enough that the tether didn't tug, far enough that Leon's warmth didn't trigger that awful Calm buff.

For a moment, silence settled.

Then Leon spoke, voice careful.

"Do you remember…" He stopped, swallowed. "Do you remember that night?"

Joonseo's breath caught.

His eyes lifted slowly.

Leon's gaze wasn't on his body now. It wasn't hungry. It was… fragile.

"The night I--" Leon's throat bobbed. "The night I messaged you and said I wasn't doing well."

Joonseo's stomach turned.

Of course Leon remembered.

That night wasn't a footnote for him. It was a turning point.

Joonseo forced his voice steady. "I… remember."

The FRAUD debuff didn't spike.

Because that, at least, was true.

Leon exhaled, relief and pain mixing on his face.

"I was ashamed," Leon whispered. "I still am. But… I wanted you to know something."

He looked down at his hands, then back up.

"You saved me," Leon said, voice rough. "Not in… in this world. Before. In the game. When it mattered."

The words landed like a weight on Joonseo's ribs.

His first instinct was to reject it--to say *it wasn't real*--but the debuff flickered threateningly, as if the system itself would punish that denial.

Because it had been real.

Not because Elizabeth was real.

Because Leon's pain was real. And Joonseo had answered it, even behind a mask.

Leon continued, voice quiet, as if speaking too loud would make it vanish.

"I didn't fall for you because you were pretty," Leon said. "I mean--yes, you were. But that wasn't it."

His cheeks flushed faintly, a flash of embarrassment.

"I fell for you because when I was… ugly inside, when I hated myself, you didn't run," Leon whispered. "You stayed. And you told me to stay too."

Joonseo's throat tightened until it hurt.

Leon's gaze held his like a lifeline.

"And now… the world is like this," Leon said softly, "and you're here. In front of me. And I'm terrified you'll disappear."

Joonseo's hands trembled.

Not from fear of monsters.

From the weight of being someone's salvation.

He swallowed hard, voice barely working.

"I'm not going anywhere," he said, because the words felt like the only thing he could give Leon without shattering him.

The FRAUD debuff didn't spike.

But something else happened.

A system chime, soft and bright, cut through the air.

A new window appeared in front of Joonseo, large and unavoidable.

**BOND QUEST UNLOCKED: TRUST LINK**
**OBJECTIVE:** Synchronize Party Resonance
**REQUIREMENT:** Physical Contact (10 seconds)
**CONDITION:** Must be Willing (Verbal Consent Required)
**REWARD:** Bond Skill Slot + Debuff Resistance (Minor)

Joonseo froze.

His skin went cold.

Leon stared at the window too, eyes widening. "You got that?"

Joonseo nodded stiffly, unable to speak.

Physical contact.

Ten seconds.

Verbal consent required.

The system was--

It was forcing closeness like a mechanic.

Leon's gaze flicked to Joonseo's face, cautious.

He didn't reach out.

He didn't move.

He waited.

"Is that… okay?" Leon asked softly.

The fact that he asked--genuinely asked--made Joonseo's chest tighten with something hot and uncomfortable.

This wasn't the game anymore. In the game, you clicked accept and your character auto-followed. Your hands didn't shake. Your skin didn't remember touch.

Here, contact meant contact.

And Joonseo's body had already reacted to Leon's nearness more than once--subtle warmth, tightening breath, a humiliation he didn't know how to name.

He didn't trust his body.

He didn't trust Leon.

He didn't trust the system.

But he needed the reward. Debuff resistance. Bond skill slot. Anything that made survival easier. Anything that might dull FRAUD's spikes.

He forced his voice out, raw and tight.

"Ten seconds," Joonseo whispered.

Leon nodded slowly. "Only if you want."

Joonseo's jaw clenched. "Don't make it weird."

Leon's mouth twitched--something like a sad smile.

"Okay," he said quietly. "I won't."

He held out his hand again, palm up. Still not moving closer.

Joonseo stared at it.

That hand had typed messages to Elizabeth for months. That hand had gripped a sword to protect her in a world that wanted to farm her.

That hand belonged to a man who had loved a lie--and might love the truth too, if Joonseo ever had the courage to show it.

Joonseo's throat tightened. He forced himself to breathe.

Then, slowly, he placed Elizabeth's hand into Leon's palm.

Contact.

Warmth.

A jolt through his skin like electricity, not painful but immediate. Leon's hand was larger, rougher at the fingertips, callused in a way that suggested work and real life rather than purely gaming.

Leon's fingers didn't curl around his.

Not yet.

He waited, as if giving Joonseo the chance to pull away.

Joonseo's breath hitched.

He hated that the warmth felt good.

He hated that his body leaned toward it.

The system chimed again, and a small countdown appeared:

**TRUST LINK -- 10… 9… 8…**

Leon's voice, barely a whisper: "Are you sure?"

Joonseo swallowed hard.

"Yes," he forced out.

The word tasted like surrender.

Leon's fingers finally closed gently around Joonseo's hand. Not tight. Not possessive. Just… steady.

The countdown ticked down.

**7… 6… 5…**

Joonseo's chest tightened.

For a moment, the world's noise faded. The crowd in the station, the distant screams outside the dome, the hum of fluorescent lights--all of it blurred behind the sensation of Leon's warmth in his palm.

And then it happened again--the bond effect.

A soft gold pulse traveled up Joonseo's arm, across the tether, and into Leon. It wasn't just Calm this time.

It felt like resonance.

Like their stats weren't the only thing syncing.

Joonseo felt Leon's steadiness bleed into him like borrowed courage.

He felt his own fear soften at the edges.

He hated how much relief it brought.

**4… 3… 2…**

Leon's thumb brushed lightly over Joonseo's knuckles--an unconscious movement, a comforting stroke.

Joonseo's breath caught.

Heat curled low in his belly, sharp and humiliating.

Not full arousal. Not yet.

But something bodily, instinctive, like this new skin was wired differently, like touch wasn't neutral anymore.

Joonseo's fingers tightened around Leon's without thinking.

Leon froze.

His eyes lifted sharply to Joonseo's face.

The look in them wasn't triumph.

It was surprise.

And something fragile, hungry, restrained.

**1… 0.**

The system chimed brightly.

**TRUST LINK COMPLETE.**
**REWARD:** Bond Skill Slot Unlocked
**REWARD:** Debuff Resistance (Minor)
**NEW BOND SKILL (Locked): CONSENT AURA -- Requires Further Synchronization**

Joonseo yanked his hand back instantly, heart hammering.

Leon didn't chase. He didn't grab.

He just sat there, palm still open, fingers slightly curled as if holding phantom warmth.

Joonseo's face burned.

He stared at his own hand like it had betrayed him.

Leon's voice came soft, careful, slightly hoarse.

"Thank you," he whispered.

Joonseo snapped, "Don't."

Leon flinched, but nodded. "Okay."

Silence fell again--thicker now.

Joonseo stared at the system window until it faded. Debuff resistance. Minor.

Not enough to erase FRAUD. Not enough to cleanse the lie.

But enough to survive a little longer.

Leon shifted slightly, re-gripping his sword.

His gaze stayed forward now, outward, guarding.

But Joonseo could feel it--like an afterimage.

Leon's touch lingering in his skin.

His body's response lingering in his gut.

The shame of wanting something he shouldn't.

The terror that he might not be able to suppress it forever.

Outside the safe zone dome, the world continued to crackle with chaos.

Inside, Leon sat beside him like a promise.

And Joonseo--Elizabeth--stared at his own trembling hands and realized the worst part wasn't the monsters, or the PKs, or the system's cruel quests.

The worst part was this:

Leon's love had started in a game.

But his touch was real.

And Joonseo didn't know how to stop his body from learning that.
