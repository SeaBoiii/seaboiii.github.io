### Chapter 6 -- **Raid Night: Gangnam**

The safe zone near Hongik University Station grew teeth by sundown.

It didn't look like it at first. It still had the dome, the rule window, the constant glow that made everyone's faces look a little less terrified. But as hours passed, the crowd stopped being a crowd and became something closer to a hierarchy.

People formed circles around whoever seemed strongest. Whoever spoke loudest. Whoever had information.

Whoever promised protection.

Joonseo watched it happen from the edge--half-hidden under Leon's cap, posture tight, cloak pulled close as if fabric could shrink his silhouette.

Leon stayed near him like a shadow that had decided to be a wall.

And the system, as if pleased with their earlier compliance, fed them more tasks like a hungry mouth.

**DAILY QUEST CONTINUES:**
**OBJECTIVE:** Clear 2 Additional Gates (Party Recommended)
**REWARD:** Skill Point +1 / Gear Chest (Basic)

Leon wanted to do them. Of course he did. Leveling meant power. Power meant safety.

Joonseo wanted to refuse on principle--refuse the way he'd refused responsibility in the game.

But he also remembered Karmine's smile and the word *loot*.

So they cleared two more small gates--quick, efficient, brutal. A warped café dungeon where the chairs bit and the espresso machine became a fire-spitting mimic. A subway stairwell gate where shadows crawled up the walls like spilled oil.

They moved better together each time, and Joonseo hated that too.

Because it meant his body was learning Leon.

Learning the rhythm of Leon's breathing when he braced a shield. Learning the exact second Leon taunted so Joonseo could throw Courage Aura over him at the perfect moment. Learning that when Leon said *behind me*, his new body obeyed before his pride could protest.

After the second gate, they leveled again.

**ELIZABETH -- Level 3**
**LEON -- Level 3**

Leon's eyes had brightened when he saw it--small, satisfied relief. He looked at Joonseo like leveling was something they'd earned together.

Joonseo looked away.

He didn't want to earn anything with Leon.

Because earning meant ownership. Connection. Something that had to be acknowledged.

The bond quest from earlier--Trust Link--had unlocked a skill slot but left a new locked line in his interface like a hook lodged under the skin:

**BOND SKILL (Locked): CONSENT AURA -- Requires Further Synchronization**

Joonseo tried not to look at it.

The system wouldn't let him forget. It hovered at the edge of his awareness the way hunger did.

By late afternoon, new banners appeared above the crowd inside the safe zone. Not system banners--player-made, guild flags, recruitment tags.

**SUNFALL GUILD -- RAID AT 21:00 (GANGNAM HUB)**
**REWARD:** EXP BOOST / SAFE ROUTE UNLOCK / RESOURCE ZONE CLAIM

The streamer-type guild leader--Joonseo had learned his name was **JAXON** from overheard whispers--was holding court near the station entrance. He spoke like he was narrating a livestream, voice loud and smooth, wearing a hybrid of real clothes and fantasy gear that made him look like a protagonist.

He raised his hands, and a system window projected above him like a hologram.

"Listen," Jaxon called in English first, then repeated in Korean, then in awkward Japanese as if to catch all the international players trapped in Seoul. "We either die alone in random streets, or we start acting like a raid team. The game rules are real now. So we use them."

People murmured.

"Gangnam Hub is bigger," Jaxon continued. "Better dome. More NPC infrastructure. We claim it tonight. We lock down the area. We set up rotations. Healers, tanks, DPS--everyone matters."

He smiled like a leader. Like a savior.

Joonseo watched from the edge with cold dislike.

Jaxon's gaze swept the crowd--and then stopped, sharply, on Elizabeth.

Joonseo felt it like a spotlight snapping on.

Jaxon's smile widened.

"Oh," Jaxon said, voice rising with delighted recognition. "No way. Are you--"

He took a step forward, eyes bright.

"Elizabeth?"

The crowd's attention shifted instantly, like the name had weight.

Whispers rippled.

"Elizabeth?"
"Like--*that* Elizabeth?"
"The Bard?"
"She's real?"
"Holy shit…"

Joonseo's stomach dropped.

Leon moved instinctively, stepping in front of Joonseo with the same quiet violence as earlier.

Jaxon held his hands up, laughing like it was friendly.

"Hey, hey. No PK in the dome," he said, grinning. "Relax. I'm just--this is insane. I've watched your raid clears. Everybody has."

Joonseo's skin crawled under the attention. He kept his chin down, cap low.

Jaxon's gaze flicked to Leon's nameplate.

"And Leon," Jaxon said, tone amused. "Of course. Of course you found her."

The way he said it made Joonseo's throat tighten.

Found her.

Like Elizabeth was a prize in the world.

Leon's voice was flat. "We're not joining."

Jaxon blinked, surprised, then laughed as if Leon had told a joke.

"You're kidding," he said. "You two are exactly who we need. Bard support and Guardian tank? That's literally tutorial meta. And it's not just for content--we're trying to keep people alive."

He leaned slightly, trying to see around Leon.

"Elizabeth," Jaxon said, softer now. "Come on. You know how this works. In the game, you don't clear raid bosses with two people."

Joonseo's jaw clenched.

In the game.

In the game, he'd loved being seen. He'd loved being wanted. He'd loved the way people begged Elizabeth to join their party, how they praised her, how they called her beautiful, how--

How they didn't know.

Now it felt like being stripped in public.

Leon's hand hovered near Joonseo's elbow--not touching, but close enough to steady if he fell.

Joonseo swallowed hard and forced his voice out.

"We'll go," he said, surprising himself. "But we're not joining your guild."

Leon turned his head sharply, eyes narrowing. "What?"

Joonseo's pulse hammered.

He didn't want to go. But the quest reward--safe route unlock, resource zone claim--those were real advantages. And staying in Hongdae where PKs had already marked Elizabeth as rare spawn was a slow death.

He kept his tone hard, like cruelty could make this sound less like fear.

"We need better safe zones," Joonseo said. "Gangnam's dome is bigger. More people. More light."

Leon's jaw tightened.

Jaxon grinned like he'd won. "See? Smart."

Joonseo wanted to punch him.

Instead, he nodded stiffly. "We go as a party. That's it."

Jaxon nodded dramatically. "Sure. Whatever. Just be there at 21:00. We move as a convoy."

He clapped his hands once like a show.

"Everybody! Gear up. Don't wander. Bring supplies. If you can't fight, stay inside the formation. We move like it's raid night--because it is."

As the crowd dispersed into frantic preparation, Leon grabbed Joonseo by the sleeve--

Not a hard grab. Not aggressive.

A reflex.

The moment fabric tightened around Joonseo's arm, the bond tether pulsed bright and a tiny buff window flickered:

**BOND EFFECT:** Calm (3 seconds)

Joonseo's breath hitched, anger flaring.

Leon released instantly, eyes wide. "Sorry."

Joonseo yanked his sleeve back. "Don't touch me."

Leon's face tightened, but he nodded. "Okay."

They moved to a quieter corner to pack inventory. Leon redistributed supplies like a logistics officer, trading out unnecessary items, making sure their emergency rations were accessible.

Joonseo watched him with irritation that edged into something else. Leon had always been like this--careful, steady, the kind of player who checked everyone's HP bars and reminded them to drink water during long raids.

That was why the night Elizabeth saved him had even been possible.

Leon had been a person who noticed when he was falling.

Joonseo hated that he'd been the one to catch him.

Because catching someone meant you were responsible for what happened after.

As they waited for night, Joonseo's mind kept circling that memory. Leon's words in the station: *You saved me.*

The reality was worse than any system debuff.

Because Leon wasn't just in love with Elizabeth's face.

He was in love with the feeling of not being alone.

And Joonseo had given him that feeling like it was a disposable item.

At 20:50, the convoy formed.

Dozens of players and survivors gathered at the safe zone boundary like a raid lineup. Tanks in front--shield icons glowing. DPS flanking--blades, bows, staffs. Healers near the center. Non-combatants clustered inside the protective ring.

Jaxon stood near the front, voice raised, calling instructions like he was leading an e-sports team.

"Keep formation. Don't chase loot. Don't break line. If you see a gate forming, call it out."

Someone asked, "What about PKs?"

Jaxon grinned. "Then we treat them like mobs."

The dome barrier shimmered and thinned. The safe zone boundary dissolved for a moment as the convoy stepped out, one after another.

Seoul at night was different now.

Not just darker.

Alive with system light.

UI markers hovered over buildings. Quest notifications blinked at the edges of people's vision. Mobs moved in alleys like glitches in reality. The city felt like a map with aggro zones.

Joonseo stayed near the center of the convoy, cap low, cloak pulled tight. Leon stayed beside him, slightly ahead, shield-ready.

They didn't speak much. The road required attention. One wrong turn, one separation, and you became prey.

They crossed the Han River as a group, moving under a bridge that looked like a dungeon entrance now--its underside stained with pixel-shadow, its pillars etched with runes that weren't there yesterday.

Somewhere in the distance, something roared--deep, metallic, like a boss waking up.

People flinched. The convoy tightened.

Leon glanced back once, eyes meeting Joonseo's.

"You okay?" Leon asked quietly.

Joonseo swallowed and forced out, "Keep walking."

Leon nodded and turned forward again.

Gangnam's hub came into view like a promise and a threat.

The district was brighter than the rest--lit by enormous billboards that now flickered with system overlays. The streets were wider, cleaner, and the hub itself--anchored at a major intersection--glowed beneath a larger safe zone dome that pulsed like a heartbeat.

**GANGNAM HUB -- SAFE ZONE (MAJOR)**
**NPC SERVICES:** Registration / Trade / Healing / Quest Board
**WARNING:** RAID GATE DETECTED -- 0.1km

The raid gate was visible even from the edge: a towering rift in the air, swirling with dark-blue light and fractured neon. Its outline was jagged, like a tear in reality stitched with pixels.

The crowd murmured in fear and excitement.

Jaxon threw his arms up like a showman.

"Welcome," he announced, voice booming. "Raid night!"

The hub NPCs stood in a line near the entrance, faces too perfect, voices too cheerful.

"Register," they chimed. "Register."

The convoy poured into the hub safe zone, and the moment they crossed the boundary, tension loosened--only slightly. People talked louder. Some laughed, the hysteria kind. Some cried quietly in corners.

Joonseo felt the rest bonus settle into his muscles like a warm blanket.

He hated how good it felt.

Jaxon moved immediately to the quest board, projecting a giant window above it for everyone to see:

**RAID GATE: "NEON ABYSS" -- LVL 5 RECOMMENDED**
**OBJECTIVE:** Clear Gate Core
**REWARD:** Hub Expansion / Resource Node / EXP BOOST
**NOTE:** Party Leaders Must Coordinate

People gasped. Level 5 recommended. Most of them were level 3.

Jaxon grinned anyway. "We do it with numbers," he said. "And we do it smart."

He started assigning roles, calling out names.

"Sunfall tanks to the front. Healers, stay mid. Ranged DPS, flank. Bards--"

His gaze snapped to Elizabeth again, hungry with excitement.

"Elizabeth," Jaxon said, voice bright. "You're with me."

Leon stiffened instantly. "No."

Jaxon rolled his eyes. "Not you, bro. I'm talking to her. She's a Bard. She's support. She belongs where she can buff the most people."

Belongs.

The word hit Joonseo like a slap.

His jaw clenched, and he forced his voice out cold.

"I don't belong to anyone."

For a heartbeat, the crowd went quiet.

Jaxon blinked, then laughed. "Okay, okay. Chill. But you know what I mean."

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like this was a private deal.

"Look," Jaxon said softly. "You want protection, right? You want to not get farmed by PKs? Then you stay near leadership. We keep you safe. We clear the gate. We unlock the hub. Everybody wins."

Joonseo's stomach churned.

Protection with strings.

Leon moved closer, shoulders squared, voice low and dangerous. "Back off."

Jaxon sighed. "Dude, I'm trying to keep people alive."

Leon didn't budge. "Then do it without talking like she's an item."

Jaxon's gaze sharpened. "She's not just 'she,' man. She's *Elizabeth.* That's a server-famous character. You realize what that means? Her presence affects morale. People fight harder when she's here."

Joonseo's skin crawled. His mind flashed to Karmine's grin, the word *rare spawn*.

Different predator. Same appetite.

Leon's jaw tightened, and his voice dropped to a near-growl.

"She's a person."

Joonseo's throat tightened.

Person.

Leon had just called Elizabeth a person.

As if the lie had earned humanity through flesh.

As if Joonseo's punishment had made the persona real enough to deserve respect.

Joonseo didn't know whether to hate Leon for it or cling to it.

Jaxon held up his hands. "Fine. Whatever. Party up however you want. But if you want to clear this gate, you need coordination."

He stepped back, already turning to bark orders at someone else.

The crowd surged into formation again, lining up near the raid gate. People checked gear. Healers pre-cast buffs. Tanks tested barriers.

Joonseo stood near the edge, heart pounding, watching the rift swirl like an open wound.

Leon stayed beside him, quiet.

Then, in the moment before they entered, Leon's voice came low.

"Elizabeth," he said.

Joonseo flinched.

Leon swallowed, then corrected himself immediately, voice rougher.

"Sorry. I--" He paused. "I just… if it gets bad in there, stay close to me. Please."

The word please again.

Joonseo's throat tightened.

He stared at the gate, at the swirling darkness, at the fact that the recommended level was higher than theirs. At the fact that Jaxon's raid might fail. At the fact that failure in this world might mean death or something worse.

And at the fact that Leon was asking to protect him again.

Asking.

Not forcing.

Joonseo swallowed hard.

"Fine," he muttered. "But don't… don't die for me."

Leon's eyes widened slightly--like he hadn't expected that.

Then his gaze softened, dangerously.

"I won't," Leon said quietly. "Not if you don't leave me behind."

Joonseo's chest tightened painfully.

Leave me behind.

The echo of a game phrase--don't log off--translated into something more real: don't disappear.

The raid gate pulsed, and a system banner unfurled above it, bright and merciless:

**RAID INITIATION IN 60 SECONDS**
**PARTY LOCK IMMINENT**

People moved.

The crowd pressed forward.

Leon stepped into the rift first, shield up, the Guardian icon above his nameplate glowing.

Joonseo followed, stomach churning, cap pulled low, cloak fluttering around legs that still didn't feel like his.

As the world inside the gate swallowed them, Joonseo caught one last glimpse of the hub crowd--eyes watching, whispering, hungry.

Elizabeth was famous.

Elizabeth was valuable.

Elizabeth was prey.

And somewhere inside that rift--inside Neon Abyss--Joonseo could feel the system tightening its grip around his lie.

Because raids didn't just test damage.

They tested trust.

They tested bonding.

They tested what you did when people depended on you.

And Leon depended on Elizabeth like a man who had once been saved and now refused to lose his savior.

Joonseo stepped into the darkness, and the city's neon disappeared behind him.

**RAID LOCK: ACTIVE.**

In the dark, Leon's voice came steady, close.

"Stay with me."

Joonseo swallowed hard, and followed.
