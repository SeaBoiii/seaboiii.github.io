### Chapter 10 -- **Soulbound**

The safe zone lock held for three more breaths.

Then it screamed.

Not a human sound--nothing so simple--but a high, crystalline whine as the barrier at the karaoke door rippled under pressure. Light bent and snapped like stressed glass. Outside, shadows shifted in impatient arcs.

Joonseo stood between the entrance and Leon's sleeping body like a bad joke the universe had decided to make sincere--Elizabeth's slim frame braced, shoulders tight, hands lifted, palms sweating.

He could feel them the way you felt a storm through a window: inevitable, testing for cracks.

Karmine's voice drifted through the barrier, amused.

"Elizabeth," they purred. "You look brave today."

Joonseo swallowed hard. His throat was dry enough to burn.

He didn't answer.

Answering gave them power.

He focused on breathing. On keeping his feet planted. On not looking back at Leon's face, because seeing him peaceful made panic sharper. Made the need to protect him feel like a blade pressed to Joonseo's spine.

The barrier shrieked again.

Joonseo cast Charm Hymn--soft, controlled--letting the note bleed through the safe zone boundary like smoke. It wasn't enough to stun them, but it made movement hesitate for a heartbeat.

A heartbeat was everything.

Because behind him--

Leon moved.

A subtle shift on the couch. A sharp inhale.

Then a voice, hoarse with sleep and instantly alert.

"Joonseo?"

The name hit like a hand around Joonseo's throat.

He didn't turn. He couldn't.

Leon's footsteps came closer--careful, controlled. Not rushing into his space, but rising into it like a tide.

"How long?" Leon asked quietly, voice low enough not to carry.

"Long enough," Joonseo whispered.

Leon's breath hitched at the tremor. He moved to Joonseo's side, just a step behind--shield position, instinctive. His sword was already in hand.

Outside, Karmine laughed softly.

"Oh. The boyfriend's awake."

Leon's jaw tightened. He didn't dignify it with a response.

"We're leaving," Leon muttered to Joonseo. "On my mark."

"They'll follow," Joonseo breathed.

Leon's gaze stayed forward. "Then we make them pay for it."

The barrier at the door cracked--visible now, hairline fractures of light.

Leon lifted his shield, and Joonseo felt the air shift as he prepared to take the first hit. Like always.

Something hard and cold settled in Joonseo's chest.

Not guilt.

Not shame.

A decision.

Joonseo stepped forward--half a pace--before Leon could.

Leon's eyes snapped to him. "What are you--"

"Behind me," Joonseo said.

The words came out in Elizabeth's voice, but the choice was his.

Leon froze, shocked. "Don't--"

"Just do it," Joonseo hissed. "For once."

Leon's jaw clenched. His eyes searched Joonseo's face like he was trying to understand what had changed in the last hour.

Outside, Vivid's magic flared again--dark-blue sparks crawling along their fingertips. The barrier trembled.

Duskbyte's arrow tip glowed with an ugly debuff.

Joonseo's UI fluttered.

**ILLUSION VEIL -- ACTIVE (RANK 2)**
**CHARM HYMN -- AVAILABLE**
**COURAGE AURA -- AVAILABLE**
**BOND SKILL SLOT: 1 (Locked Skill Present)**

The bond skill line flickered like a half-open door.

**CONSENT AURA -- Locked**

As if the system wanted to remind him: some power only came when you stopped lying with your body too.

The barrier shrieked again.

The karaoke door exploded inward in a burst of crackling blue light and splintered wood.

Duskbyte's arrow whistled through the opening like a curse made physical.

Karmine surged in behind it, daggers flashing.

Joonseo didn't run.

He cast Illusion Veil at point-blank range, flooding the doorway with bent light. The arrow's trajectory warped, slamming into the wall instead of Leon's chest. Karmine stumbled as the room's depth perception twisted, their body reacting to a space that no longer obeyed.

Vivid's spell hit the veil and scattered into glittering static.

Leon's shield rose behind Joonseo instinctively, catching the edge of the chaos.

But Joonseo stayed in front.

His hands shook.

His voice didn't.

"Charm Hymn," he whispered.

The note unfurled--darker than Courage, heavier than comfort--sliding into Karmine's nervous system like a hand on the back of their neck. Their movement stuttered. Their pupils widened. For half a breath, their predatory confidence slipped.

Joonseo used that half-breath to cast Courage Aura--over himself.

Not over Leon.

Over the body that had become the target.

Gold light wrapped around his limbs like armor made of song.

Leon's breath hitched behind him. "Joonseo--"

"Move," Joonseo snapped.

This time Leon did.

Leon surged forward at the edge of Joonseo's veil, shield-first. Not to protect Elizabeth.

To fight with him.

Karmine recovered fast--too fast--lunging again with a snarl. Leon met them with a shield slam that drove them back into the broken doorway.

Duskbyte tried to fire again from outside.

Joonseo bent the light. The arrow hit nothing.

Vivid cursed and began a longer cast, hands glowing brighter. They were trying to tear the minor safe zone's residual protection apart.

The street outside was dark. If Vivid broke the boundary fully, the room wouldn't be sanctuary anymore. It would be a cage.

Joonseo's heart hammered. His mana trembled, but the earlier confession reward--moderate resistance--kept the FRAUD instability from ruining his spells.

He didn't need to win.

He needed to buy a path.

"Leon," Joonseo said sharply, "left."

Leon understood instantly. He feinted right and then drove left, forcing Karmine's attention to split. Duskbyte shifted their aim. Vivid's spell flickered.

Joonseo threw the veil outward--wider, thicker--turning the room into a mirage of corridors and false exits. To a predator, it looked like prey multiplying.

Karmine's eyes widened. "What the--"

Leon moved through the confusion like a blade.

He slammed his shield into Karmine's ribs--hard enough to make them gasp--and knocked them out into the street.

Duskbyte stumbled backward, swearing.

Vivid's cast finally launched--dark-blue spear aimed at the doorway--

Joonseo stepped into it.

He didn't fully understand his own body's limits yet, but he understood one thing:

Leon couldn't take another hit like last time.

The spear struck Joonseo's aura and slammed into his chest like a cold hammer. Pain lanced through his ribs. His vision flashed white.

He staggered.

Leon's voice tore out, raw. "Joonseo!"

Joonseo's knees buckled.

Leon caught him automatically--arms wrapping around him, pulling him back from the threshold.

The contact jolted the bond tether.

And this time, instead of a small buff, the system *rang like a bell*.

A massive window erupted into Joonseo's vision.

**ATONEMENT -- CONDITION MET**
**PROTECT LEON: COMPLETE**
**REWARD:** Party Resonance Restored (High)
**BOND SKILL UNLOCKED:** CONSENT AURA
**SYSTEM OFFER:** SOULBOUND DUO EVOLUTION AVAILABLE

Leon's breath hitched behind him. "You--what did you do?"

Joonseo forced air into his lungs. Pain pulsed in his chest like a heartbeat.

"I--" he tried, then swallowed hard. "I wasn't going to let you--again."

Leon's arms tightened around him, a reflexive hold that was equal parts fury and relief.

Outside, Karmine swore, rising to their feet with blood at the corner of their mouth.

"This is cute," they spat. "But you can't hide forever--"

The street shook.

Not from magic.

From the system itself.

A new banner unfurled across the night sky, visible even through the fractured doorway.

**WORLD EVENT: HUB EXPANSION -- GANGNAM**
**NEON ABYSS: GATE CORE UNSTABLE**
**WARNING:** PK FLAGS UNDER REVIEW

The safe zone boundary shimmered brighter, reacting to the world event. The minor safe zone's protection thickened unexpectedly--like a temporary blessing.

Karmine's nameplate flickered.

Duskbyte's arrow tip dimmed.

Vivid's spell fizzled as if the world had briefly decided: *Not now.*

Karmine stared at the shifting banners, then spat on the ground.

"Fine," they hissed. "Another time."

They backed away into the street darkness, retreating like predators forced to drop a kill--eyes promising they'd remember.

When they were gone, silence fell hard.

Leon still had his arms around Joonseo.

Joonseo's breath was uneven. His body hurt, but the pain was clean compared to the ache in his chest that had lived there for days.

Leon pulled back slightly, just enough to look at him.

His eyes were glossy, angry, terrified.

"Why?" Leon demanded, voice shaking. "Why would you do that?"

Joonseo swallowed, throat burning.

"Because you didn't deserve to be hurt again," he whispered. "Not because of me."

Leon stared at him like he didn't know where to put his hate anymore.

Then, abruptly, Leon looked away and dragged a hand down his face, breath shuddering. When he looked back, his voice was lower.

"You're bleeding," Leon said.

Joonseo tried to laugh and it came out like a broken sound. "So are you."

Leon's jaw clenched. He reached into his inventory and pulled out bandages.

He didn't ask permission this time.

He still didn't touch.

He held the bandage out, waiting.

Joonseo stared at it, chest rising and falling.

Then he nodded once.

Leon stepped closer--slow--and wrapped the bandage around Joonseo's chest where the spear had struck. His hands were careful, restrained, as if he was terrified that touching would make everything worse.

It made everything worse anyway.

Because every brush of Leon's knuckles against his skin sent heat crawling through Joonseo's body like a confession his mind didn't want to make.

Joonseo squeezed his eyes shut, breathing through it.

Leon finished tying the bandage. His fingers lingered for half a second at the knot.

Then he pulled back.

"You're shaking," Leon whispered.

Joonseo swallowed hard. There was no point lying; the system had trained that out of him.

"I am," Joonseo admitted.

Leon's gaze lifted to his face. Something softened in it--something exhausted and real.

"We shouldn't stay here," Leon said quietly. "Too exposed."

Joonseo nodded. "Then… where?"

Leon hesitated, then said in a voice that sounded like surrender:

"Somewhere private."

--

They found it a few blocks away: a small office building inside a minor safe zone radius, its lobby dim and empty, its stairwell narrow. They climbed to an upper floor where the windows were cracked but high enough that the street couldn't easily see them.

Leon used the system lock again.

The door shimmered and sealed.

The room they chose was an abandoned meeting space--glass walls, a long table, chairs pushed aside. Someone's potted plant lay dead in the corner. The city outside glowed like a broken circuit board.

Joonseo sank onto the floor, back against the wall, breathing hard.

Leon paced once, then stopped, hands trembling slightly as he pushed hair back from his forehead.

He looked like a man holding himself together with thread.

Joonseo stared at him and felt something shift inside him--something that had been resisting and resisting and resisting until it could no longer hold.

"Leon," Joonseo said.

Leon flinched at the name, gaze snapping over like it hurt.

Joonseo swallowed. "I need to tell you something."

Leon's jaw tightened. "If it's another apology--"

"It's not," Joonseo interrupted.

Leon stilled.

Joonseo's face burned. His heart hammered. His body still remembered Leon's hand from the Trust Link, still remembered the way his skin had reacted, still remembered warmth like it was a drug.

He forced the words out because the truth was heavier than shame.

"When you--when you touched me before," Joonseo whispered, voice shaking, "it felt… too good."

Leon's eyes widened slightly.

Joonseo's throat tightened, tears threatening because he hated how vulnerable this sounded.

"I'm scared," Joonseo admitted. "Because if it feels like that… I might get addicted to being a woman."

He swallowed hard.

"And that scares me. Because I don't know what that makes me. I don't know if I'm losing myself. Or if I never knew myself in the first place."

The room went very quiet.

Leon's expression broke in slow motion--anger giving way to something raw and human.

He took one step forward, then stopped, like he remembered boundaries.

Joonseo's breath shuddered. "Don't say it's fine," he whispered. "Don't--don't make it easy."

Leon's voice came low.

"It doesn't matter anymore," Leon said.

Joonseo blinked, throat tight. "What?"

Leon stepped closer again, slower this time, and knelt in front of him--not towering, not dominating. Just close enough that his presence filled Joonseo's space like warmth.

Leon's hands hovered near Joonseo's face, trembling slightly, still waiting for permission.

Joonseo's breath caught.

Leon spoke softly, like he was afraid the wrong tone would shatter him.

"It doesn't matter what you were," Leon said. "Or what you thought you were."

His eyes searched Joonseo's--steady, aching.

"What matters is what you choose now," Leon whispered. "And you just chose to protect me."

Joonseo's chest ached.

Leon's voice softened further. "And… I can't pretend I don't feel it. Even after everything. I can't pretend I don't--"

He stopped, swallowed hard, then said it anyway like stepping off a ledge:

"I'll hold you through the fear."

Joonseo's breath broke.

Leon's arms finally wrapped around him--gentle at first, then tighter, firm enough to make Joonseo feel contained in the best way, like the world couldn't reach him through Leon's body.

Joonseo shuddered.

For the first time since the sky split, the shaking eased--not because danger was gone, but because he felt *safe* inside someone else's steadiness.

Leon's hand cradled the back of his head.

Leon's mouth brushed his hairline, a kiss so soft it felt like mercy.

Joonseo's eyes stung. "Leon…"

Leon's voice against his temple was a whisper. "I'm here."

Joonseo's throat tightened around a truth he'd been resisting like it would kill him.

"I feel loved," he whispered, voice breaking. "And I don't know what to do with that."

Leon pulled back just enough to look at him, eyes dark and wet.

"You don't have to do anything," Leon murmured. "Just… let it be true."

Joonseo inhaled shakily. He looked at Leon's face--at the anger that had softened into something exhausted and tender, at the grief still present but no longer sharp enough to cut.

Acceptance didn't arrive like a celebration.

It arrived like surrender.

"Okay," Joonseo whispered.

Leon's thumb brushed lightly under his eye, wiping a tear Joonseo hadn't realized had fallen.

"What are you okay with?" Leon asked, voice low, careful.

Consent.

Always consent.

Joonseo's face burned, but he made himself say it.

"With you," he whispered. "With… this. With being--"

His throat closed. He forced the words out.

"I've accepted being a woman," he said, voice trembling. "But… only for you."

Leon's breath hitched sharply.

His eyes flashed with something hungry and reverent--and then he reined it in, like he was terrified of taking too much.

"Say it again," Leon whispered.

Joonseo swallowed.

"Only for you," he repeated, quieter.

Leon's forehead pressed to his for a moment, eyes closed like he was praying.

Then he looked up, gaze burning.

"Can I kiss you?" Leon asked.

Joonseo's heart hammered.

"Yes," he breathed.

Leon kissed him.

Slow at first. Like he was relearning him. Like he was trying to honor the fragility between them instead of swallowing it whole.

Joonseo's body reacted immediately--heat curling through him, breath catching, fingers gripping Leon's hoodie as if he needed something solid to hold onto.

Leon deepened the kiss, careful and relentless, a steady pressure that made Joonseo's thoughts dissolve into sensation--warmth, breath, the scrape of Leon's stubble against his skin, the undeniable fact of being wanted.

Joonseo pulled back a fraction, shaking, breath ragged.

Leon stopped instantly, eyes searching. "Too much?"

Joonseo shook his head, trembling. "No. Just… I'm scared."

Leon's hands cupped his face gently. "Then we go slow."

Something inside Joonseo steadied--like he'd finally stopped fighting the body long enough to hear what it was asking of him.

His voice came out as a whisper.

"Don't call me Joonseo," he said.

Leon froze. "What?"

Joonseo's chest tightened painfully. He forced himself to say it anyway, because the truth was hotter than shame.

"I don't want that name right now," he whispered. "Not when you touch me. Not when you--when we--"

His face burned.

Leon's gaze stayed on him, stunned, reverent, waiting.

Joonseo swallowed hard, voice shaking.

"Call me Elizabeth," he whispered. "From now on."

Leon's breath caught.

Joonseo's eyes stung. He pushed through it.

"And… forever," he added, voice breaking. "If you can."

The room went still.

Outside, Seoul's neon flickered through cracked glass. Inside, Leon looked at her like she'd handed him something sacred--and terrifying.

Leon's voice came low, rough with emotion.

"Elizabeth," he whispered.

The name hit her body like a wave.

Not as a lie.

As a choice.

Elizabeth shuddered, breath catching. "Yes."

Leon kissed her again--harder now, hunger threaded with devotion. Elizabeth melted into it, fingers sliding up Leon's shoulders, pulling him closer like distance was unbearable.

Leon's hands moved with permission, not assumption--one at her waist, then pausing, eyes asking again without words.

Elizabeth nodded, breath trembling.

Leon's palm pressed gently against her, anchoring. Elizabeth felt the heat of it through fabric, felt her body soften, accept.

The kiss turned into a slow unraveling--clothes shifting, breath thickening, the room filling with the sound of their quiet desperation.

Leon kept asking in murmurs--*Is this okay?*--and Elizabeth kept answering in broken yeses, and every consent felt like another lock opening in her chest.

They moved to the floor fully, tangled in cloak and hoodie and trembling hands.

Leon's mouth traced warmth along Elizabeth's jaw, her throat, the pulse point that made her gasp and grip Leon's shoulders like she might float away.

Elizabeth's body responded with humiliating honesty--arching into touch, breath turning ragged, the new sensitivity overwhelming in waves.

She whispered, shaky, half-laughing, half-crying, "This is why I was scared."

Leon's lips brushed her cheek.

"I know," Leon murmured. "I've got you."

Elizabeth clung to him, shaking. "Say it again."

Leon's arms tightened around her, firm and safe. "I've got you, Elizabeth."

The name made Elizabeth's breath break.

Leon kissed her like a vow.

And when they crossed the line into full intimacy, it wasn't rushed, it wasn't taken--it was built, slow and consuming, made of permission and need and the way Leon held her like the world couldn't touch her.

Then Elizabeth's breath fractured the moment her body reached the edge of what it could take.

It was sharp--too sharp--enough that the sound that tore out of her didn't feel like something she chose. Her nails dug into Leon's shoulders. Her face tightened, eyes squeezed shut as a flare of pain split through the heat, shocking and raw, making her whole body seize.

"It hurts--" she gasped, voice breaking on the words.

Leon froze instantly.

Not the way someone hesitates, but the way someone stops because her voice mattered more than hunger, more than momentum, more than anything.

"Hey," Leon murmured, hands firm at her waist, anchoring her. "Look at me."

Elizabeth forced her eyes open, lashes wet, breath trembling. Leon's gaze held hers--steady, terrified, gentle.

"I'm here," he said, voice low. "We can stop. We can slow down. Tell me what you need."

He pulled her into his chest, wrapping her in warmth, letting her feel his heartbeat like a promise. His mouth brushed her temple, her cheek--soft, grounding kisses meant to bring her back into her body instead of letting the moment swallow her whole.

Elizabeth shook--half from the sting, half from the way pleasure kept rising anyway, overwhelming and relentless, twisting through her nerves like lightning. It terrified her that she could hurt and still want, that her body could tremble with both at once.

Leon's hands didn't move again until she gave him permission.

"Elizabeth," he whispered. "Do you want me to continue?"

Her throat worked. She swallowed, breath hitching as she tried to separate fear from desire.

"I--" she gasped, voice shaking, then steadied as she forced honesty through the haze. "It hurts."

Leon nodded, not denying it, not minimizing it.

"I know," he said softly. "I won't push. We go at your pace."

Elizabeth's fingers tightened in his hoodie, clinging as if she could pull herself out of fear by holding onto something real.

Then, barely above a whisper, she gave him the truth that terrified her most.

"Don't stop," she breathed.

Leon went still again--checking.

Her eyes met his.

She nodded once, more firmly this time, voice trembling but clear.

"Continue," she whispered. "I'm okay. I want you."

Leon exhaled shakily, forehead resting against hers like prayer.

"Okay," he murmured. "I'm here. Tell me if you want me to stop--immediately."

Elizabeth nodded, breath ragged.

And when they moved again, it was slower--careful, measured, built around her breathing and her cues. Leon stayed wrapped around her, holding her through every tremor, murmuring her name like an anchor.

The pain didn't vanish all at once, but it softened at the edges, giving way--inch by inch--to warmth that spread through her body like a flood. Pleasure rose, dizzying and bright, making her gasp into Leon's shoulder, making her feel too much and not enough at the same time.

Elizabeth clung to him, overwhelmed--hurting, wanting, shaking--until the fear finally cracked and she realized she was still safe.

Still held.

Still chosen.

And when the pleasure finally swallowed the last of her panic, it wasn't because Leon took it from her.

It was because she let him--fully, willingly--while he stayed close enough to catch every broken breath.

After, the room was quiet except for their breathing.

Elizabeth lay against Leon's chest, wrapped in his arms, cloak half-tangled beneath them like a discarded flag.

Leon kissed Elizabeth's hair gently, repeatedly, as if reassuring himself she was real.

Elizabeth's body still hummed with afterglow, warmth lingering like a spell.

A system chime rang--quiet, private, almost tender.

A window appeared at the edge of their vision, glowing softly:

**SOULBOUND DUO EVOLUTION -- AVAILABLE**
**CONDITIONS MET:**

* Party Resonance: Restored (High)
* Consent Aura: Activated
* Atonement: Initiated
  **CHOICE:** Accept / Decline

Leon's breath hitched. "You see it?"

Elizabeth nodded, heart pounding again--this time not from fear.

Soulbound meant permanent link. Shared buffs. Shared penalties. A vow made mechanical.

A promise the system would enforce.

Leon looked down at her, eyes dark.

"Do you want this?" Leon asked quietly. "Truly?"

Elizabeth swallowed.

She thought of the world outside: PKs, mobs, hunger, the way people looked at her like loot.

She thought of the lie that had become flesh.

She thought of the confession that had shattered Leon--and the fact that Leon had still stayed.

She thought of how Leon had just held her through fear and heat and identity like none of it made her less worthy.

Elizabeth exhaled, shaking.

"Yes," she whispered. "With you."

Leon's gaze softened, pain and devotion braided together.

"Elizabeth," Leon said, voice thick, "I'm not letting you go."

Elizabeth's throat tightened.

"Then don't," she whispered.

They reached for the window at the same time and pressed **ACCEPT**.

The system chimed, bright as dawn.

**SOULBOUND DUO -- CONFIRMED**
**ELIZABETH → Siren Saint (Evolution)**
**LEON → Oath Paladin (Evolution)**
**EFFECT:** Shared Resonance / Consent-Locked Buffs / Betrayal Penalty (Severe)

A thin gold line flared between them--stronger than the old tether, warm and steady like a heartbeat.

Leon pulled Elizabeth closer and kissed her forehead.

Elizabeth blinked.

Then--slowly--she pouted, lips pushing forward in a way that was half teasing and half scandalized by her own audacity.

"That's it?" she murmured.

Leon froze, breath catching. "What?"

Elizabeth's eyes held his--warm, bright, and unafraid in a way she didn't recognize until she realized: she liked it. The power of it.

"How about round two," she whispered, voice lower, silkier. "But this time…"

She shifted, straddling his hips with deliberate care, palms pressing to his chest, feeling the way his breath staggered beneath her.

"I'll take the lead."

Leon's eyes widened. "Elizabeth--"

She cut him off with a kiss--deeper, hungrier--tongue sliding against his like a claim she was finally brave enough to make.

Leon made a sound into her mouth, half surprise, half surrender, and his hands lifted instinctively--then stopped, hovering, waiting for her cue.

Elizabeth smiled against his lips, breath hot.

"Yes," she whispered, granting permission without breaking the gaze.

Leon's hands settled on her waist--firm, reverent--while Elizabeth pushed him back onto the floor like she'd been born with the confidence.

She pinned him there with her weight and her look, watching the way Leon's composure fractured, watching how the man who had always been the shield now lay beneath her, breathing like he was the one being undone.

Elizabeth's voice trembled--not with fear this time, but with thrill.

"I think this addiction is real," she confessed, staring at him with hunger she no longer tried to deny. "And there's no way I'm returning back to being a man."

Leon's expression broke--relief and desire and something tender, something desperate.

He reached up, cupping her face like she was the only truth left in the world.

"Then don't," he whispered. "Stay with me."

Elizabeth swallowed, eyes shining.

"Call me," she breathed.

Leon's gaze held hers, dark and devoted.

"Elizabeth."

She smiled like it hurt--like it healed.

"Again," she whispered.

"Elizabeth."

The gold line between them pulsed brighter, syncing with their breath as if the world itself approved of this--choice, consent, a bond taken willingly.

Elizabeth leaned down, biting gently at Leon's lower lip--not hard enough to hurt, just enough to make him gasp and grip her tighter.

"Good," she murmured, voice shaking with want. "Because I'm not letting you go either."

And when they moved together again, it wasn't fear driving Elizabeth.

It was hunger.

It was safety.

It was love made physical--messy, chosen, and shameless.

Outside, Seoul's neon chaos continued--quests spawning, monsters roaming, players whispering rumors into the night.

Inside the sealed room above the city, Elizabeth owned the moment, owned her body, owned the name she had chosen--only for Leon, forever--while Leon held her like he was finally home.

And for the first time since the sky had split open and written their fate in system text, the future didn't feel like a punishment.

It felt like something they had chosen.
