### **Epilogue -- Party of Three**

In the first month after the Collision, Seoul learned a new kind of fear.

Not the fear of mobs in alleyways, or verdict rings under your feet, or the sudden realization that your hands no longer belonged to you.

A quieter fear.

The kind that travelled from mouth to mouth in safe zones the way rumors used to travel on trains:

*Don't mess with Leon and Elizabeth.*

People didn't even have to describe them anymore. Just the names were enough.

Leon--an Oath Paladin whose shield could hold a corridor alone, who moved like the world owed him a path and he intended to take it. The tank who didn't just protect; he *decided* who survived.

Elizabeth--a Siren Saint with a voice that turned panic into discipline, whose light could steady a party on the edge of collapse, whose illusion could swallow a street whole and make predators question their own eyes.

They weren't a guild.

They didn't recruit.

They didn't preach.

They didn't wear banners.

They were simply… there, in the places where people couldn't survive alone.

A two-man raid team that cracked gates meant for armies. A pair that moved like a single organism: shield and song, wall and tide. When a dungeon gate swelled ugly and hungry on the edge of a district, someone would always say, with an exhale that sounded half like prayer:

"Maybe Leon and Elizabeth will take it."

Even the PKers learned the new math.

Karmine's crew--once so smug, once so certain that rare spawns were meant to be farmed--stopped hunting near Gangnam entirely. Not because they suddenly grew morals, but because they grew memory.

A shattered rib from Leon's shield. A charm that made their hands hesitate at the wrong second. A veil that turned their confidence into confusion.

Predators could respect one thing, if nothing else:

A prey that became a threat.

In time, it wasn't only fear that changed. Korea began to change its shape.

The streets stayed familiar, but society rewired itself around the system's logic.

Safe zones became districts of light with councils and rotating guards. Old hospitals became hybrid clinics--doctors and healers working side by side, bandages and cleanse spells existing in the same sterile room. The government--what was left of it--adapted in pieces, folding into guild leadership and hub administration, creating rules that weren't laws anymore, but *quest conditions.*

And the people adapted too.

They stopped saying *player* like it was a joke.

They started saying *adventurer* like it was a job.

A new era didn't arrive with ceremony. It arrived with routine.

And Leon and Elizabeth--once a scandal, once a whispered drama in a raid--became something else entirely:

A couple no one should mess with.

A legend that walked.

---

The morning Elizabeth vomited, it was almost insulting in how normal it felt.

Not the vomit--nothing about the taste and the burn and the sudden betrayal of her stomach felt normal--but the setting did.

A cracked window. Early light. Seoul quiet in that fragile, temporary way it sometimes became between gate alarms. Leon's hoodie thrown over a chair. The faint pulse of their Soulbound line visible only when Elizabeth blinked too slowly.

Elizabeth had been cleaning her staff. Habit. Comfort. Something to do with her hands while her mind replayed last night's raid in slow motion.

Then her throat tightened.

She blinked once, confused, and the world tilted.

Her stomach rolled with an unholy certainty.

Elizabeth covered her mouth, sprinted two steps, and barely made it to the small sink before she retched hard enough that her knees trembled.

The sound woke Leon instantly.

The air changed.

Not in a metaphorical way--Leon genuinely moved like a defensive skill had been triggered. He was on his feet in a heartbeat, sword half in hand before his brain fully caught up.

"Elizabeth?" His voice was thick with sleep and sharp with fear. "What--what is it? Are you poisoned? Was it the ration? Did you--"

"I'm fine," she croaked, but her stomach disagreed violently and she vomited again.

Leon was at her side immediately, one hand on her back--firm, anchoring--and the other already flicking through his UI like he was ready to cleanse a debuff, ready to taunt the universe itself.

Elizabeth coughed, wiped her mouth, breathing hard.

Leon's eyes scanned her like he was searching for a red status icon over her head.

"Any dizziness?" he demanded. "Blurred vision? Fever? If this is a curse--"

Elizabeth lifted a shaking hand, half laughing, half horrified.

"Leon," she rasped. "Stop. I'm not dying."

Leon didn't relax. He didn't know how. Not when it came to her.

Elizabeth rinsed her mouth, stared at her own reflection in the cracked mirror above the sink.

Pale. Eyes glossy. Lips slightly swollen from how hard she'd bitten them to keep from gagging.

She blinked slowly.

And then the thought hit her--not softly, not gently, but like a system notification dropping into her skull.

Period.

Elizabeth went still.

Leon's hand tightened on her shoulder. "What?"

Elizabeth swallowed, throat burning.

"I… I never--" She paused, trying to assemble the timeline through the fog of nausea. "Leon, I never had my period."

Leon stared.

Elizabeth's breath came shallow.

"At first I thought it was because the world changed," she said quickly, like speed could outrun fear. "Because the system rewrote anatomy. Because--because everything is different, right? And we were fighting every day and sleeping in safe zones and--"

Leon's gaze sharpened. "How long?"

Elizabeth stared at the sink as if it could answer.

"The whole month," she whispered. "The first month after… after I became her." She swallowed hard, then forced herself to continue. "And then after that too. I didn't think--because there was no time to think. But Leon…"

Her voice broke slightly.

"It's been three months."

Leon didn't move.

For a moment, his face looked blank, like his mind refused to process the word.

Then--quietly--his eyes widened in a way that made Elizabeth's stomach flip again, not with nausea this time but with terror.

"No," Leon whispered, as if denying it could protect her. "No, because--because the system--"

Elizabeth laughed weakly, almost bitter.

"Yeah," she said. "Because the system."

Then she looked up at him, eyes glassy.

"And because… we didn't exactly wait long."

Leon's throat bobbed.

Elizabeth could see every thought in his face: their first time, her pain, her consent, the way they'd clung to each other like the apocalypse needed a counter-spell.

Leon's hands flexed at his sides, like he wanted to grab her and also wanted to run.

Elizabeth wiped her mouth again. Her fingers were trembling.

"There's a convenience store down the street," she said, voice thin. "They've got those… kits."

Leon's eyes snapped to hers. "We're not going out."

Elizabeth blinked. "Leon--"

Leon's voice turned hard, defensive mode fully engaged. "Not after last week. Not after that PK faction started circling hubs again. Not after--"

"Leon," Elizabeth cut in, sharper than she intended.

He froze.

Elizabeth inhaled slowly, steadying her breath the way she did before raids.

"I need to know," she said quietly.

Leon stared at her for a long second.

Then his shoulders dropped--just a fraction--as if he'd remembered that protecting her didn't mean controlling her.

"Okay," he said hoarsely. "We go now. We go fast. We don't speak to anyone."

He paused, eyes dark.

"And if someone looks at you wrong, I'm going to break them."

Elizabeth's mouth twitched despite herself.

"That's my tank," she murmured.

Leon didn't smile.

But he did reach out and lace their fingers together.

Not because the system demanded it.

Because he did.

---

The pregnancy kit felt absurd in her hands.

A flimsy piece of plastic and paper in a world where dragons existed in the mountains and dungeon gates bloomed in subway stations. A tiny item with no rarity color, no stat bonus, no glowing description text.

Just…

Two lines, or one.

Elizabeth locked the safe zone door behind them and leaned against it as if the building itself might judge her. Leon hovered in the middle of the room like a man waiting for a verdict ring.

Elizabeth's hands shook as she followed the instructions. She kept thinking: *Maybe it'll be negative. Maybe the system doesn't--maybe it can't--maybe it changed something.*

Then she set it down on the table and stared at it like it was a boss countdown.

Leon didn't blink.

Neither did she.

The minutes passed like hours.

Then the line appeared.

Clear.

Unmistakable.

For half a second, Elizabeth couldn't breathe.

Then she screamed.

Not a cute squeal. Not a dramatic gasp.

A full, shocked, disbelieving scream that cracked into laughter halfway through because her body didn't know what emotion to prioritize.

Leon lunged to the table like he was intercepting an attack, eyes wild.

"What--what is it?"

Elizabeth pointed with a shaking finger, tears already threatening.

Leon stared at the strip.

His face changed in layers.

First confusion.

Then recognition.

Then disbelief.

Then something that looked like his chest was collapsing and expanding at the same time.

Leon made a sound--small, broken--and pressed a hand to his mouth like he might throw up too.

Elizabeth laughed through tears and grabbed his wrist, forcing his hand down.

"Leon," she whispered, voice shaking. "Leon--look at me."

His eyes snapped to hers.

She saw it then, fully:

Leon wasn't just stunned.

He was overwhelmed.

He was terrified.

He was--underneath everything--radiant.

"I'm… I'm going to be a dad," he whispered, like the words didn't fit in his mouth yet.

Elizabeth's throat tightened so hard it hurt.

"And I'm…" she began, then choked, blinking hard as tears spilled anyway. "I'm going to be a mother."

The word mother should have felt impossible, like a glitch.

Instead, it landed with an odd rightness.

Not because she'd always dreamed of it.

But because she'd already learned one truth in this world:

Bodies could change.

But love--real love--was still something you chose.

Leon stepped forward like gravity had pulled him, and he wrapped Elizabeth in his arms so tightly she gasped.

Elizabeth clung to him, shaking, crying into his shoulder.

Leon's voice against her hair was rough.

"I'm here," he whispered. "I'm here."

Elizabeth pulled back, eyes wet. "I'm scared."

Leon swallowed, eyes shining.

"Me too," he admitted.

Elizabeth laughed weakly, wiping her cheeks. "This is my first time with… all of this. Every part of it. I don't even--Leon, I used to be a guy. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm supposed to--"

Leon cupped her face, thumb brushing her cheek gently.

"You don't have to know everything," he murmured. "You just have to tell me what you feel. And we figure out the rest."

Elizabeth trembled. "What if something goes wrong?"

Leon's gaze hardened--not in anger, but in vow.

"Then I'll be there," he said. "Every appointment. Every night. Every fear. Every time you vomit again."

Elizabeth let out a wet laugh, tears still falling.

Leon kissed her forehead, then her temple.

"We've cleared raids meant for armies," he whispered. "We can do this."

Elizabeth stared at him, heart swollen and terrified.

"Promise?" she whispered.

Leon pressed his forehead to hers.

"Promise," he said.

---

The months that followed didn't feel like a montage.

They felt like learning.

Elizabeth learned her body again--not through panic this time, but through curiosity and cautious care. She learned the strange shift of appetite, the way smells could become enemies, the way fatigue could flatten her even after a full night in a rest bonus safe zone.

She learned that being strong wasn't always swinging a staff or holding a buff rotation.

Sometimes strength was admitting she needed to sit down.

Sometimes strength was crying because she felt helpless and letting Leon hold her anyway.

Leon learned too.

He asked questions with the seriousness he used to reserve for raid mechanics. He watched pregnancy videos on salvaged tablets. He talked to women in safe zones who'd given birth before the Collision and after it--mothers whose bodies had also been rewritten by the system, mothers who now raised children in a world of quests and mobs.

They found a class in a hub clinic--half run by doctors, half by healer-types who treated the body like both biology and status window. Elizabeth sat on a folding chair with other pregnant women under a flickering fluorescent light while a nurse explained nutrition like it was a buff list.

Leon sat beside her like a shield in human form.

Whenever someone whispered *That's Leon and Elizabeth,* Leon didn't look up.

He didn't bask.

He didn't posture.

He just kept his hand on Elizabeth's knee, steady and warm, as if the world's opinion didn't matter compared to her breathing.

They adjusted diets. Learned what foods made nausea worse. Found a prenatal vitamin stash in an old pharmacy dungeon gate and treated it like legendary loot.

They built a home in a safe zone district that had evolved from "survivor camp" into "community." People still cleared gates. Still formed parties. Still trained.

But they also cooked. Shared resources. Taught children how to recognize aggro markers and when to stay inside the dome.

The world didn't return to normal.

It became something else.

By her last trimester, Elizabeth's belly was unmistakable.

Her body moved differently again, not with the shock of transformation but with the slow gravity of motherhood. She caught herself looking at her reflection sometimes and smiling--small, private, disbelieving smiles that tasted like peace.

Leon became absurdly vigilant.

If Elizabeth so much as sighed too sharply, Leon was already asking if she needed to sit, drink, rest, or if he should call the clinic.

Elizabeth teased him mercilessly.

"My paladin," she'd say, fond and amused. "Relax."

Leon would scowl, then soften immediately, hand on her belly like he was memorizing the fact that this was real.

When their daughter kicked for the first time, Leon cried.

He tried to hide it. Failed.

Elizabeth laughed until she cried too.

---

The day Elizabeth went into labor, the sky over Seoul was pale and clear.

No raid banners. No hub alarms.

Just a strange calm that made everything feel even more unreal.

They reached the clinic in a convoy--because Leon refused to let anyone risk touching her on the street. The safe zone district had its own medical wing now, carved out of an old hospital, reinforced with system barriers, staffed by exhausted professionals and healers who'd learned to cooperate.

The operating theatre wasn't fully modern anymore. It was hybrid.

Sterile lights and clean sheets… and faint glowing circles etched into the floor like protection wards. A doctor in scrubs… and a healer in robes, hands already shimmering with a gentle restorative aura.

Elizabeth lay on the gurney, hair pulled back, breathing through waves that made her whole body tense.

Leon hovered like a man possessed.

Elizabeth glanced up at him and laughed--actually laughed--because Leon's face looked like he was about to fight the surgeon.

"You look terrifying," Elizabeth wheezed.

Leon's voice cracked. "Are you okay?"

Elizabeth blinked slowly, then smiled even as another contraction tightened her ribs.

"I've been through raids that should've killed me," she said, voice shaking with humor and pain. "You think I'm going to lose to this?"

Leon swallowed hard. "This isn't a raid."

Elizabeth's smile softened.

"No," she agreed. "It's scarier."

Leon's eyes shone. He leaned down, forehead pressed to hers, hands shaking.

Elizabeth's laughter faded into something tender.

"It's strange," she whispered, breath hitching. "A few months ago, I was… someone else. Catfishing. Hiding. Laughing."

Her eyes stung unexpectedly.

"And now I'm here," she whispered. "Giving birth. With the love of my life beside me."

Leon's voice was thick. "Elizabeth--"

Elizabeth reached up and cupped his cheek, thumb brushing the edge of his jaw.

"I love you," she whispered. "And I'm glad you accepted me. All of me."

Leon's breath broke.

"I didn't just accept you," he murmured. "I chose you."

Elizabeth smiled through tears. "Good. Then keep choosing me."

Leon kissed her knuckles like a vow.

A nurse cleared her throat gently. "Sir--"

Leon looked up like he was ready to argue.

The nurse softened. "You can't go into the theatre room yet. We need to prep her."

Leon's posture stiffened. "I'm not leaving."

Elizabeth laughed again, squeezing his hand.

"Leon," she murmured. "Look at me."

Leon's gaze snapped back to hers instantly.

Elizabeth smiled, eyes bright despite pain.

"I'll be fine," she said.

Leon's throat bobbed. "Promise?"

Elizabeth lifted her brows, a teasing flash of old confidence.

"I'm a Siren Saint," she said. "I literally refuse to die."

Leon made a sound that was almost a laugh, almost a sob.

Elizabeth squeezed his hand once.

"Wait for me," she whispered.

Leon's voice dropped, raw. "Always."

They wheeled her away.

The doors closed.

Leon stood outside the operating room like a man stripped of armor.

He paced. Stopped. Punched his own thigh in frustration. Whispered prayers under his breath. Kept checking the clock like time was an enemy he could taunt.

Inside, Elizabeth screamed.

Not pretty screams. Not cinematic.

Real ones.

The kind that stripped language down to breath and raw sound.

Leon's hands trembled. He pressed his palm to the door like he could send his shield through it.

He could fight dragons.

He couldn't fight this.

Minutes bled.

Then hours.

Leon looked up every time someone walked down the hall.

Finally, a doctor stepped out, mask hanging around her neck, eyes tired but smiling.

Leon froze.

The doctor didn't make him wait.

"Congratulations," she said gently. "It's a girl."

Leon's knees nearly buckled.

He made a broken sound and slapped a hand over his mouth.

The doctor continued, voice warm. "Both mother and baby are healthy."

Leon's breath shattered.

He laughed. He cried. He did both so hard it felt like his ribs might crack.

"A girl," he whispered, dazed. "We have--"

His voice broke completely.

The doctor touched his shoulder gently. "You can see them now."

Leon didn't walk.

He *ran.*

---

Elizabeth looked exhausted in a way Leon had never seen.

Not even after the Neon Abyss.

Not even after PK ambushes.

This was different.

This was sacred damage.

Her hair was damp with sweat, face pale, but her eyes--her eyes were bright and calm and strangely triumphant.

And in her arms--

A tiny bundle.

So small it looked impossible that it had been inside her.

Elizabeth looked up as Leon stumbled into the room.

Her mouth curved weakly.

Leon fell to his knees beside the bed, hands hovering like he was afraid to touch the wrong thing and break the world.

Elizabeth's voice came out hoarse and soft.

"Hi, Dad."

Leon made a sound that wasn't language.

Elizabeth's eyes shimmered with tears.

She tilted the bundle slightly.

Their daughter's face scrunched, mouth opening in a small sound that was both fragile and fierce.

Leon stared like he was being rewritten again.

Elizabeth watched him, heart full in a way that frightened her.

"This is… ours," she whispered, barely believing it.

Leon's hand finally touched the baby's tiny fingers, trembling.

"She's warm," he breathed.

Elizabeth laughed weakly. "Yes, Leon. Babies are warm."

Leon looked up at Elizabeth, eyes wrecked with love.

"You did this," he whispered.

Elizabeth's throat tightened. "We did."

Leon leaned forward, kissed her forehead, and this time it wasn't teasing or lustful or playful.

It was reverence.

"Thank you," he whispered.

Elizabeth blinked hard, tears spilling anyway.

"Don't thank me," she whispered. "Just stay."

Leon's voice cracked.

"Always."

---

Years passed the way seasons passed now--measured in raids cleared, safe zones expanded, children growing up under dome lights that felt like the new sky.

The world never went back.

It moved forward.

Korea became a lattice of light and danger and community. Guild councils formed. Trade routes became party-protected convoys. Schools taught math and swordwork. Children learned to read and to check their status windows.

And Leon and Elizabeth--once a power duo--became something even rarer:

A power family.

Their daughter grew up with Leon's steadiness and Elizabeth's spark. She was loud when it mattered. Quiet when it mattered more. She learned to fight before she learned to fear. She learned that a party wasn't just a mechanic.

It was a promise.

On the day they faced the dragon, the sky over the mountains was bruised purple with storm.

A world boss had awakened--ancient, scaled, vast enough that its shadow swallowed entire ridgelines. Its roar rolled across the valleys like an earthquake.

Other guilds watched from a distance, forming lines and contingencies and plans.

Because everyone knew dragons weren't just monsters.

They were statements.

Leon stepped forward first, shield glowing with Oath Paladin light, stance grounded like a mountain refusing to move.

Elizabeth stood behind him, staff humming faintly, Siren Saint aura coiling around her like song given shape. Her eyes were calm, lips curved with familiar confidence.

Between them, their daughter rolled her shoulders, blade flashing in her hand--a damage dealer born of two legends, grin sharp and bright.

Above their heads, nameplates floated:

**LEON -- Oath Paladin**
**ELIZABETH -- Siren Saint**
**ARIA -- Stormblade (DPS)**

The dragon lowered its head, eyes like molten gold.

Guilds in the distance held their breath.

Because the trio didn't look afraid.

They looked… ready.

Leon lifted his shield.

"Formation," he said, voice steady.

Elizabeth's voice slid into the air like a spell.

"Always," she murmured.

Their daughter laughed, feral and fearless.

"Let's go."

The dragon roared.

Leon took the first hit like a wall.

Elizabeth's song flared, wrapping them in light.

And their daughter surged forward like lightning, blade carving a bright line through the storm.

In a world rewritten by quests and gates and the brutal honesty of survival, the legend had evolved.

Not a couple.

A family.

A party of three.

And as the dragon's shadow fell over them, Elizabeth felt Leon's presence steady in front, felt her daughter's wild energy beside, felt her own power rise like music--

and thought, with a fierce, tender certainty:

This was the life she had chosen.

And she would protect it--properly.
