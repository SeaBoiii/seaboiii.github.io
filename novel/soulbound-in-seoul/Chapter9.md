### Chapter 9 -- **Atonement (Locked)**

Leon didn't speak to Joonseo for hours.

Not truly.

He spoke in short, functional sentences--directions, warnings, necessities--but nothing that felt like *a person talking to another person*. It was like the moment Joonseo confessed, Leon had shut a door inside himself and left Joonseo standing outside it in the cold.

They stayed within party range because the system demanded it, but Leon kept distance like it was a boundary drawn in blood.

Joonseo followed three steps behind at all times.

Not because he was obedient.

Because he didn't know what else to be.

The Gangnam hub, for all its bright dome and NPC services, couldn't hold them forever. The gate might reopen. PKs might slip into the periphery. The crowd's attention had sharpened into a hungry shape after Kairos' reveal.

Rumors moved faster than mobs.

By midnight, Joonseo could feel the safe zone's atmosphere shift every time they passed: a hush, then whispers, then stares that lingered too long.

Not the appreciative stares from before.

These were… different.

Some were disgust.

Some were gloating.

Some were predatory in a new way--like "Elizabeth is compromised" made him less protected, more vulnerable.

Joonseo's stomach churned.

He kept his cap low and his cloak pulled tight, but it didn't matter. The body was still the body. The face was still the face.

And now, the name--Elizabeth--wasn't just famous.

It was infamous.

At the edge of the hub's dome, near a cluster of vending machines that still glowed faintly, Leon finally stopped.

He looked at the boundary line on the floor like he was studying a decision.

Then he spoke without turning around.

"We're leaving," Leon said.

Joonseo's breath caught. "Where?"

Leon's shoulders tensed. "Somewhere quieter."

Joonseo's mouth went dry. "Are you--are you going to…"

Kick me?

Leave party?

Abandon me outside the dome?

He didn't say it. Pride welded his tongue.

Leon's voice stayed flat. "Don't ask questions you already know the answer to."

Joonseo flinched.

Leon turned his head slightly, not fully facing him. His expression was rigid. Controlled.

"We need a place to sleep," Leon said. "And I don't want an audience."

Joonseo's throat tightened.

He nodded once. "Okay."

Leon stepped out of the safe zone.

Joonseo followed.

The moment the dome's protection dissolved behind them, the city's weight returned--heavier air, darker corners, the faint sense that the world outside was constantly watching for weakness.

Joonseo's mini-map flickered back on now that he was out of the hub's interference. Safe zones glowed like islands. Streets were outlined in pale blue.

Leon didn't head toward another major hub.

He headed toward smaller safe zone markers--dim shields tucked away in side streets.

A place with fewer people.

Fewer eyes.

Leon walked fast. Purposeful. Joonseo kept pace behind him, heart thudding, body hyper-aware of every shadow.

They passed under a billboard that still flickered with a cosmetics ad--now overlaid with system text like a wound:

**EVENT ACTIVE: APPEARANCE SKINS DISABLED (REALITY LOCKED)**

Joonseo swallowed bile.

As if the world itself wanted to mock him: *You can't change how you look. You can't hide behind customization anymore.*

Leon's voice came quiet, clipped. "Stay close."

Joonseo's pride flared. "You told me not to--"

Leon stopped so abruptly Joonseo nearly collided with him.

Leon turned, eyes dark.

"Stay close," Leon repeated, slower, sharper. "Not because I care how you feel about it. Because if something happens, I need you within buff range."

Buff range.

Practical language.

A way to ask for proximity without acknowledging what proximity meant.

Joonseo's throat burned.

He nodded.

They continued.

A faint gold pulse ran along the tether between them when the distance tightened, but there was no Calm buff now. No warmth. The bond felt muted--like the system itself had put a hand over their connection, waiting to see if it would heal or rot.

They turned into a narrower street lined with closed boutiques and dim cafés. A small shield icon hovered above a building entrance--an old karaoke place, the neon sign half-dead, the glass door cracked.

**SAFE ZONE -- MINOR**

Leon tested the doorway with his hand. A faint barrier shimmered, then let them through.

Inside, the air warmed slightly. Not as strong as a hub dome, but enough to soften the sharp edge of danger.

The place smelled like stale smoke and spilled alcohol, like a memory of weekends before apocalypse.

Leon moved immediately to lock the door--not with a key, but with the system. A small window popped up as he touched the handle:

**SAFE ZONE LOCK: ENABLE / DISABLE**
**NOTE:** Lock reduces entry, increases siege risk if discovered.

Leon enabled it.

The door's barrier shimmered thicker.

Only then did he turn fully to Joonseo.

They were alone now.

No crowd. No whispering.

Just the two of them and the soft hum of a minor safe zone.

Leon's gaze held Joonseo's face for a long, brutal second. Not with longing.

With assessment.

Like he was staring at a stranger wearing someone he used to love.

Joonseo's stomach twisted.

Leon's voice came low.

"Say it again," Leon said.

Joonseo blinked. "What?"

"My name," Leon said, jaw clenched. "You called me Leon all this time. Say it again. But say it like you mean it."

Joonseo's throat went dry.

Leon's eyes sharpened. "Or can you not separate your lies from your truth?"

The accusation stabbed deep.

Joonseo swallowed hard. "Leon."

Leon flinched--not physically, but in the eyes. Something tightened, something wounded.

"That sound," Leon whispered, voice rough. "That voice. You used it on me."

Joonseo's hands trembled. He forced himself to stand still.

"I'm sorry," he said.

The FRAUD debuff flickered, but didn't spike. Apology wasn't a lie.

Leon's mouth twisted. "Don't."

Joonseo's heart pounded. "I'm--"

Leon stepped forward suddenly, closing distance like a weapon.

Joonseo's breath caught.

Leon stopped inches away, too close.

Joonseo could smell sweat and faint blood on Leon's hoodie, could see the red smear dried at his collar.

Leon's eyes were glossy with exhaustion and anger.

"You don't get to say sorry and make it clean," Leon hissed.

Joonseo's throat burned. "I know."

Leon stared at him like he wanted to tear him apart and couldn't decide how.

Then Leon stepped back sharply, as if the closeness had disgusted him.

He turned away, pacing once along the room's edge like a caged animal.

Joonseo stood still, hands clenched, feeling the new body's sensitivity like a curse. He could feel his own heartbeat too loudly. He could feel the air brushing his thighs under the short skirt.

He hated it.

Leon stopped by a couch, then spoke without looking at him.

"We sleep in shifts," Leon said. "You take first watch."

Joonseo blinked. "Me?"

Leon turned his head slightly. "Yes. You."

The words hit Joonseo like a slap.

Not because he didn't deserve it.

Because Leon was giving him responsibility--the one thing Joonseo had avoided in the game.

In raids, Leon had always been the one who watched. The one who stayed awake. The one who took first watch in real life too, if there was such a thing.

Now Leon was handing that role to Joonseo like a test.

Or punishment.

Or both.

Joonseo swallowed hard. "Okay."

Leon's shoulders loosened by a fraction, as if he'd expected resistance and hadn't gotten it.

He tossed a blanket onto the couch and sat down with his sword within reach. He didn't lie down. Not yet. He just stared at the wall like his mind was still trapped in the Neon Abyss.

Joonseo stood near the door, watching the barrier shimmer faintly.

His fingers twitched at the edge of his skill menu. Buffs. Illusions. Crowd control.

He could fight mobs.

He could hide from PKs.

But he didn't know how to fight this room--the silence, the guilt, Leon's grief.

Minutes stretched.

Leon's breathing slowed slightly, exhaustion winning.

Joonseo's mind, painfully, returned to the question Leon had asked earlier:

*So what are you now?*

He didn't know.

But he knew what he had been: a coward behind a persona, laughing at someone's love.

And now he was trapped in the shape of that persona, forced to face the consequence of being wanted.

The irony made him sick.

A system chime broke the quiet.

A window appeared in front of Joonseo, smaller than the confession quest but just as heavy.

**NEW QUESTLINE AVAILABLE: ATONEMENT**
**STATUS:** Locked
**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Protect Leon from Hostile Encounter** (1)
2. **Refuse to Misrepresent Identity** (Ongoing)
3. **Restore Party Resonance** (Threshold) 
WARNING: Misrepresentation escalates FRAUD

Joonseo stared at it.

Protect Leon.

The world wanted to flip the script.

It wasn't enough to confess. Confession was only the door.

Atonement required action.

Joonseo's throat tightened.

He glanced toward Leon on the couch. Leon's eyes were closed now, but his brows were drawn like he was still fighting in his sleep.

Leon had saved Elizabeth in the raid.

Leon had saved Elizabeth from PKs.

Leon had saved Elizabeth from the world's hunger--over and over.

Now the system demanded repayment.

Joonseo swallowed hard.

He didn't know if Leon would ever forgive him.

He didn't know if he deserved forgiveness.

But he could do one thing.

He could keep Leon alive.

Joonseo's gaze returned to the door.

Outside the minor safe zone, the street was dark. Quiet. Too quiet.

He focused on listening--on the faint echoes of movement, on the subtle shifts in the air like footsteps in a hallway.

Minutes passed.

Then--

A sound.

Not inside the safe zone.

At the boundary.

A faint scraping, like someone testing the barrier.

Joonseo's breath froze.

He leaned closer to the door, eyes narrowed.

Another scrape.

A muffled voice, low, outside:

"Elizabeth's in here."

Joonseo's blood turned to ice.

PKs.

They'd followed the rumor.

He glanced back at Leon instinctively.

Leon was asleep.

For the first time since the world collapsed, Leon wasn't the one watching.

Joonseo's heart slammed.

This was it.

Atonement.

Not a romantic gesture. Not a dramatic speech.

Just--

Protect him.

Joonseo lifted his trembling hands and opened his skill menu.

Illusion Veil. Charm Hymn.

He activated Illusion Veil first, pushing mana outward in a controlled wave.

Gold light shimmered across the room's interior, bending shadows, muffling visibility from the outside.

**ILLUSION VEIL -- ACTIVE (RANK 2)**
**EFFECT:** Concealment + Sound Dampening (Minor)

He moved silently to the edge of the safe zone boundary and pressed his palm near the barrier--not touching Leon, not waking him.

Outside, silhouettes hovered in the street.

Nameplates flickered faintly through the barrier's shimmer, distorted but readable:

**KARMINE -- Level 4 -- Rogue**
**DUSKBYTE -- Level 4 -- Ranger**
**VIVID -- Level 3 -- Mage**

Joonseo's stomach dropped.

They'd leveled up.

They'd gotten stronger.

And they were here.

Karmine's voice drifted through the barrier, amused.

"Open up, Elizabeth. No safe zone lasts forever."

Vivid laughed softly. "She's with Leon, right? I wonder if he knows yet."

Joonseo's chest tightened painfully.

They knew.

They were weaponizing it.

Karmine's silhouette leaned close to the barrier. "We're not here to kill you," they purred. "We're here to *collect*."

Joonseo's hands shook.

He wanted to run to Leon, to wake him, to beg him to help--

But Leon had set boundaries. Leon had told him: *You take first watch.*

This was his.

Joonseo swallowed hard and cast Charm Hymn--slow, controlled.

The spell didn't pass through the barrier. Not directly.

But the sound did--faintly.

A soft, low note that slid through the cracks in the safe zone's magic like smoke.

Karmine's silhouette paused.

Their head tilted slightly.

Vivid's posture stuttered.

It wasn't a full stun--safe zone barriers dampened hostile magic--but it was enough to buy seconds.

Joonseo used those seconds to do what he'd never done in the game:

He moved first.

He stepped away from the door, moved deeper into the room, and positioned himself between the entrance and Leon's sleeping body.

He turned, back to Leon, facing the barrier like a shield.

Elizabeth, the character designed to be adored, now standing as a wall.

His heart hammered so hard it felt like it might crack his ribs.

Outside, Karmine laughed again, shaking off the charm's haze.

"Cute," they said. "She thinks she can protect him."

Joonseo's voice came out low, shaking--but real.

"Leave," he said.

Karmine's silhouette leaned closer. "Or what?"

Joonseo swallowed hard.

Or I'll fight.

Or I'll die.

Or I'll--

The system chimed softly in his vision.

**ATONEMENT -- PROGRESS AVAILABLE**
**CONDITION:** Hostile Encounter Imminent

Joonseo's fingers tightened.

He didn't have to win.

He just had to hold.

Hold long enough for Leon to wake.

Hold long enough for the safe zone to matter.

Hold long enough to prove--to the system, to Leon, to himself--that he wasn't only a liar behind a screen anymore.

Outside, Vivid's hands flared with magic.

The barrier shimmered, strained.

Duskbyte raised a bow, arrow glowing with a debuff effect.

Karmine drew daggers.

And inside the locked karaoke room, Joonseo stood trembling in Elizabeth's body, cap shadowing his eyes, cloak like a flag he hadn't earned--

guarding Leon.

For the first time, the gold tether between them pulsed not with Calm, not with comfort--

but with something heavier.

Like the bond itself had recognized the shape of repayment.

Joonseo whispered, almost to himself, voice raw:

"Stay asleep," he begged. "Just… stay alive."

The barrier crackled.

The PKs pressed closer.

And the safe zone door shook--once, twice--as if the world outside had decided that rules were just another mechanic to exploit.
