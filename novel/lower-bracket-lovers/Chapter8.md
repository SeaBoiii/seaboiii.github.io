Title: Lower Bracket - The Ugly Wins
novel: lower-bracket-lovers
order: 8
---

The lower bracket didn't feel like a second chance.

It felt like being shoved out of the bright main road and into the alley where the lights didn't reach.

In the hallway outside the warm-up rooms, Enzo pressed his back against a vending machine that hummed softly, offering cold drinks with cheerful buttons. The machine's glow cast a sickly tint over his hands. He watched his fingers--still trembling from the loss to Bosphorus Titans--curl and uncurl as if they belonged to someone else.

Sixteen minutes.

That was all it had taken for the defending champions to erase them.

Enzo had replayed the match in his mind until the moments blurred: the first invade that wasn't a fight but a warning; the objective bait that made Bayu bleed; the way their plan had forced Titans to pause and then, calmly, rewrite it.

A pause was not victory.

A pause was a courtesy.

He closed his eyes and tried to breathe the way Mira had told him to.

In.

Out.

Write yourself back.

The phrase kept returning, stubborn as a heartbeat.

A door clicked open behind him.

Tia stepped into the hallway.

She didn't look like she'd slept. Her hair was pulled back tight, but loose strands clung to her cheeks. The lanyard around her neck hung slightly crooked, as if she'd put it on without checking a mirror.

She held a folder this time, not just a phone.

Paper.

Enzo felt his stomach tighten.

Tia's gaze landed on him.

"Come," she said.

Her tone wasn't angry.

It was worse.

It was controlled.

Enzo pushed off the vending machine and followed.

They walked down the corridor past staff doors and sponsor booths. Somewhere nearby, a crowd cheered for another match, the roar muffled by concrete. Every sound felt distant, like Enzo was underwater.

Tia stopped at a small conference room with frosted glass and a sign that read **MEETING ROOM B**.

She opened the door.

Inside, Rangga was already there, seated at the table with his hands clasped. Bayu sat opposite him, legs spread, posture aggressive even in stillness. Adit hovered near the wall like he wasn't sure he deserved a chair. Fikri stood by the window, looking out at the city as if the traffic could answer questions.

The room smelled like air-conditioning and stale coffee.

Tia closed the door behind Enzo.

"Okay," she said.

The word landed heavy.

Bayu let out a humorless laugh. "Okay. Here comes the leash."

Tia's eyes flashed. "Bayu, one more comment and I will mute you like you mute randoms in ranked."

Bayu's jaw clenched.

He leaned back, silent but simmering.

Tia placed the folder on the table.

She didn't open it yet.

She looked at all of them first, like a manager assessing whether her team could survive information.

"We play lower bracket tomorrow," she said. "Single elimination from now on. One loss and we go home."

Adit swallowed hard.

Rangga nodded once, calm, as if he was already organizing their next draft in his head.

Bayu's eyes were sharp. "Who first?"

Tia glanced down at her phone, then back up. "Shivana Esports."

Enzo's mind supplied the rest automatically.

A mid-tier SEA team from Thailand, known for chaotic brawls and early-game skirmishes. Not polished, but dangerous. The kind of team that could drag you into mud and win by enjoying it.

Bayu smirked faintly. "We can beat them."

Tia didn't react.

She opened the folder.

Paper slid across paper.

Enzo felt his throat tighten.

"This," Tia said, "is the sponsorship proposal from Cheng Group."

Bayu made a sound like he'd bitten something sour.

Adit leaned forward despite himself.

Rangga's gaze remained steady.

Tia flipped to the first page.

A logo.

Cheng.

Clean and expensive.

"We don't sign anything today," Tia said, voice flat. "But we need to talk."

Bayu's voice came low. "Why? So we can sell ourselves politely?"

Tia's eyes cut to him. "So we can decide if we want to be homeless politely."

The room went silent.

Enzo's chest tightened.

Tia continued, the words blunt now, stripped of manager politeness.

"We lost two scrim partners because of the leak. We lost a sponsor. Our accommodation deal is shaky. We are still here because the tournament organizers are obligated to keep us here. After this event, if we don't place well, we go back to the same problems--only with more eyes on us."

Adit's fingers twisted together.

Rangga's jaw tightened slightly.

Bayu's nostrils flared.

Tia turned a page.

"Cheng Group offers: new bootcamp apartment, equipment upgrades, salary stipends for players, travel and visa support, security at events, PR management."

Adit's eyes widened. "That's… everything."

Bayu's laugh burst out. "Exactly. Everything. Including our necks."

Tia didn't deny it.

She turned another page.

"Conditions," she said.

Enzo's stomach dropped.

Tia read, voice clipped:

"**Non-disclosure agreement**. **Media training and approval**. **No personal statements or content implying romantic association**. **No public meetings**. **No private meetings at venue without approval**. **A morality clause**."

Morality.

The word tasted like a courtroom.

Adit blinked. "Morality clause?"

Tia's gaze flicked to Enzo.

Then away.

"It means," she said carefully, "players agree to conduct that doesn't damage sponsor reputation."

Bayu snorted. "So we become dolls."

Rangga's voice was calm but tight. "What about team control? Draft? Training?"

Tia flipped a page. "They don't care about gameplay. They care about optics."

Bayu leaned forward, eyes sharp. "Optics means they care about Enzo."

Enzo's stomach tightened.

He kept his face neutral.

Tia's eyes narrowed. "Bayu."

Bayu's voice rose. "What? We all know. This is because of the influencer. Because of the leak. Because of the romance story."

Enzo's jaw clenched.

He didn't want to fight.

Not now.

But the room was too small for silence.

"It's not just romance," Enzo said quietly.

Bayu's eyes snapped to him. "Then what is it?"

Enzo swallowed. He forced his voice steady.

"It's power," he said. "They saw a story they don't like. Now they want to control it."

Rangga nodded slowly.

Fikri's gaze shifted from the window to the table.

Tia's eyes stayed on Enzo for a long moment.

Then she said, softer, "Yes."

Adit's voice trembled. "But… if we take it, we survive."

Bayu scoffed. "Survive as what?"

Adit's eyes flashed. "As a team that has chairs, Bayu. As a team that doesn't eat instant noodles every day. As a team that can actually practice like the big names."

Bayu's jaw clenched.

Rangga held up a hand, calm. "We decide after lower bracket run. We don't let this split us now."

Tia nodded. "That was my plan."

Bayu's laugh came out bitter. "Cheng Group doesn't wait. Rich people don't wait."

Tia's mouth tightened.

"They gave a deadline," she admitted. "Forty-eight hours."

The room went cold.

Enzo felt his stomach drop.

Forty-eight.

Knockouts didn't give them time.

Lower bracket could end tomorrow.

Or it could stretch.

The deadline was not neutral.

It was pressure disguised as generosity.

Adit whispered, "So… if we keep winning, we can push them."

Tia's eyes sharpened. "If we keep winning, we have leverage."

Bayu snorted. "So we have to win."

Rangga's voice was steady. "We always had to win."

Enzo's chest tightened.

He thought of Mira's message.

Then win.

He looked at the folder on the table.

Cheng.

He imagined Mira's mother holding this paper like a leash, smiling politely.

He imagined Mira upstairs, tired, trying to protect him.

He imagined his mother in Manila, folding clothes, praying in her own way--through work, through survival.

Enzo's fingers curled.

"Okay," Rangga said, breaking the tension. "We focus on tomorrow. Shivana. We win. Then we talk again."

Bayu exhaled sharply through his nose.

Adit nodded too fast.

Fikri murmured, "Okay."

Tia closed the folder and stood.

"Phones away," she said again. "Sleep. Eat. Tomorrow we fight."

As they filed out, Bayu brushed past Enzo, shoulder bumping his lightly.

Not hard.

Not accidental.

A message.

Enzo didn't react.

He couldn't afford to.

***

That night, Enzo dreamed in fragments.

A minimap.

A crowd chanting a name.

A contract with words that crawled like ants.

A green dot blinking on and off.

When he woke, his mouth was dry and his hands were cold.

The morning of lower bracket smelled like instant coffee and determination.

Rangga had made everyone eat.

Not a proper meal.

But enough.

Rice from a takeout box, fried egg, tempeh, a banana each.

Adit complained softly--too nervous to swallow.

Bayu ate with aggressive speed.

Fikri ate slowly, as if trying to calm his body by respecting time.

Tia didn't eat.

She drank coffee and stared at her phone.

Enzo watched her for a moment, then looked away.

He didn't want to see the shape of her exhaustion.

They arrived at the venue early.

The crowd for lower bracket matches was smaller, but sharper--people who liked fights more than narratives.

Still, Enzo saw cameras.

Still, he saw phones.

Still, he felt the invisible eyes of the internet.

As they walked through the corridor, a teenager in a tournament shirt glanced up and whispered to his friend.

Enzo didn't catch the words.

But he saw the grin.

He saw the phone tilt.

He kept walking.

In the warm-up room, Shivana Esports sat in a loose circle, laughing loudly, their energy almost careless.

Thai voices bounced off the walls. Someone slapped someone's shoulder. Someone shouted a joke.

They looked relaxed.

Like they didn't feel the noose.

Enzo envied them.

Or maybe he feared them.

Teams that laughed in lower bracket were either stupid…

or terrifying.

Rangga gathered Kuda Hitam close.

"Shivana wants brawl," he said low. "They will invade. They will force fights early. We don't match ego. We match timing."

Bayu grinned, eyes bright. "I like brawl."

Rangga's gaze sharpened. "Not stupid brawl."

Bayu's grin thinned.

Enzo flexed his fingers.

He felt the green-dot keychain in his pocket.

He left it there.

He couldn't afford softness on stage.

***

The moment they stepped under stage lights, the air changed.

Not just temperature.

Pressure.

The world narrowed into headset hum and caster voices.

"…lower bracket elimination match! Kuda Hitam versus Shivana Esports--who goes home today?"

Enzo sat down and forced his posture steady.

His hands didn't shake now.

They knew what to do.

Draft began.

Shivana banned aggressively--comfort removals, jungle pinch.

Kuda Hitam answered with stability.

Rangga gave Enzo a hero that could survive.

Not flashy.

Not a highlight pick.

A hero that could hold when everything else collapsed.

The game loaded.

At one minute, Shivana invaded.

Four-man.

No subtlety.

They wanted blood.

Bayu's voice rose in comms, excited. "Fight!"

Rangga's voice snapped. "Trade! We take their buff."

Enzo moved.

He rotated through fog, silent.

He reached the opposite jungle.

He saw it--Shivana's buff, untouched.

He signaled.

"Here," Enzo said quietly.

Fikri arrived.

They stole.

Clean.

Shivana got first blood elsewhere.

But Bayu got compensation.

The map stayed even.

Shivana tried again.

A three-man dive bot.

Adit burned flicker.

He survived with sliver health.

The crowd roared at the near-kill.

Enzo's heartbeat stayed steady.

He watched the minimap.

He saw Shivana's mid leaving lane too early.

He called it.

"Mid missing. Care top."

Rangga rotated.

Bayu shadowed.

Shivana's roam arrived and found nothing.

Time wasted.

Enzo exhaled.

Controlled chaos.

They weren't winning fights.

They were winning decisions.

At five minutes, Shivana forced turtle.

This time, Rangga called contest.

Bayu dove in.

Enzo rotated.

Adit arrived on time.

The fight erupted.

Health bars dropped fast.

Shivana's roamer engaged with confidence.

Bayu nearly died.

Enzo held his skill.

Waited.

Then--

He struck.

A stun that caught two.

Rangga layered his control.

Adit's damage landed clean.

Two kills.

Turtle secured.

The crowd erupted.

Enzo's chest tightened with adrenaline.

But Shivana didn't collapse.

They adjusted.

They dragged the game into constant skirmishes--small fights in jungle, messy trades at side lanes.

Kuda Hitam made mistakes.

Adit chased once and died.

Bayu overforced and gave shutdown.

Rangga's call came late and cost a tower.

It was ugly.

Not the clean macro of Shinobi.

Not the disciplined cruelty of Bosphorus Titans.

Ugly wins were full of blood.

Enzo felt his teeth grind.

This was the mud.

This was where lower bracket lived.

At twelve minutes, gold was nearly even.

Shivana started lord.

Not because they had a good setup.

Because they wanted to force.

Rangga's voice tightened. "We contest. But careful."

Bayu's voice rose. "We can fight."

Enzo swallowed.

He saw the angle.

Shivana's backline was clustered.

Too close.

Too eager.

"Wait," Enzo said quietly. "Let them commit. Then I flank."

Rangga hesitated half a second.

Then, calm: "Okay. Do it."

Enzo moved through fog, hugging the wall.

He could hear the caster's voice rising.

"…Shivana starting the lord--Kuda Hitam hovering--will they fight?!"

Enzo's heartbeat thudded.

He waited.

Lord's health dropped.

Shivana committed to finish.

Now.

Enzo struck.

He dove into the backline with a speed that felt like instinct.

Stun.

Burst.

Adit followed.

Rangga engaged front.

Bayu secured the lord--barely.

The fight was chaos.

Shivana's damage nearly melted Enzo.

His health dropped to a sliver.

He retreated, then turned, then retreated again, body moving on muscle memory.

Adit cleaned up.

Three down.

Lord secured.

The crowd roared.

Enzo exhaled hard.

His hands shook now.

Not fear.

Adrenaline.

They pushed.

They cracked mid.

Shivana defended desperately.

At sixteen minutes, their base fell.

Victory.

The screen flashed.

Enzo ripped off his headset and for a moment everything sounded too loud.

Bayu shouted something in Indonesian that sounded like triumph.

Adit laughed, wild.

Rangga's shoulders dropped, relief visible.

Tia clapped once off-stage.

Not celebration.

Approval.

They survived one.

Ugly.

But alive.

***

Back in the corridor, Enzo's phone buzzed.

He checked before Tia could glare.

Mira.

**MiraCheng:** I SCREAMED

Enzo's mouth twitched.

A small smile, reluctant.

He typed:

**Enzo:** we won

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** i know. i saw your flank. you were crazy

Enzo exhaled.

Crazy.

He hadn't felt crazy.

He'd felt necessary.

He typed:

**Enzo:** we have another match today

A pause.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'll stay online

Enzo's throat tightened.

He almost typed: *don't.*

But he didn't.

He couldn't take her anchor away.

He slid the phone into his pocket and walked back toward the warm-up room.

Tia's voice stopped him.

"Enzo."

He turned.

Tia stood near a staff door, phone pressed to her ear, then she lowered it.

"Come," she said.

Enzo's stomach tightened again.

Another meeting.

Another rope.

He followed her into a smaller room.

This one was empty except for two chairs.

Tia closed the door.

She looked at him.

"Your girlfriend's mother is persistent," she said.

Enzo flinched.

Girlfriend.

The word felt too big for what he and Mira had admitted out loud.

"She's not--" Enzo began.

Tia held up a hand. "I don't care what label you use. I care about consequences."

Enzo swallowed.

Tia exhaled. "They want to meet you."

Enzo's stomach dropped.

"Me?"

Tia nodded once. "Cheng Group representatives. And… her mother."

Enzo felt cold.

He pictured Mira's mother on the cream sofa, sharp smile, printed photo.

He pictured her voice, soft and steel.

"What do they want?" Enzo asked, voice careful.

Tia's gaze was tired. "They want your signature. They want you to agree to the clause. They want you to become safe."

Safe.

Enzo's jaw clenched.

"And if I refuse?"

Tia's mouth tightened. "Then they might still sponsor the team without you. They might push for roster changes. Or they might withdraw entirely. But they will protect their daughter either way. That part is not negotiable."

Enzo's throat burned.

So it was coming.

Not a suggestion.

A decision.

He stared at Tia.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

Tia's eyes flickered--human for a moment.

"I want you to play," she said quietly. "I want you to win. I want you to keep this team alive. And I want you to not get destroyed by rich people who think they can rewrite your life."

Enzo's chest tightened.

"Then don't let them meet me," he said, voice rough.

Tia's mouth tightened. "I tried. They have access. They have connections. They can get a meeting slot in this venue faster than I can get a scrim partner."

Enzo swallowed.

He understood that kind of unfairness.

"We have another match," Enzo said, clinging to the only thing he could control.

Tia nodded. "Yes. So we delay."

She leaned closer, voice lower. "After your next match, they want ten minutes. Just ten. In a private lounge."

Ten minutes.

Enzo's stomach twisted.

Ten minutes could change a life.

Tia's gaze held his.

"Whatever happens," she said, "don't promise anything on the spot. Don't let them corner you with kindness. If you feel pressured, you tell me. You say, 'I need my manager.' Understand?"

Enzo swallowed.

"Okay," he whispered.

Tia exhaled.

Then she opened the door.

"Go," she said. "Warm up. We fight again."

Enzo stepped back into the corridor and felt the air change.

The stage lights were waiting.

So were the contracts.

***

Their second elimination match was against a team from Vietnam--**Saigon Mirage**--known for fast rotations and brutal midgame dives.

They weren't a giant.

But they were polished.

The kind of team that punished sloppy mistakes.

Kuda Hitam was tired.

Enzo could see it in Bayu's eyes--bloodshot, bright.

In Adit's shoulders--tense, cramped.

In Rangga's voice--steady but thinner.

Lower bracket demanded stamina.

It demanded pain.

The casters framed it as a momentum test.

"…can Kuda Hitam keep the miracle alive, or will Saigon Mirage end the run?"

Enzo sat at his station and forced his breath calm.

In.

Out.

Write yourself back.

The draft began.

Saigon Mirage targeted Enzo this time.

They banned his stable heroes.

They wanted him uncomfortable.

Rangga's voice came through comms, calm but tight. "Enzo, can you play this?"

Enzo swallowed.

It wasn't comfort.

But it was workable.

"Yes," he said.

The game loaded.

From minute one, Saigon played like they had rehearsed it.

They invaded with vision.

They rotated on exact timings.

They didn't chase kills.

They took map.

Enzo felt the familiar suffocation returning.

Not as clean as Bosphorus Titans.

But enough.

At three minutes, Bayu got caught.

First blood.

Bayu cursed.

Adit's voice trembled. "We're behind."

Rangga's voice snapped. "Reset. Play."

But Saigon didn't let them reset.

They dove bot at five.

Adit barely escaped.

They took turtle.

They invaded jungle.

Enzo's lane was pressured.

He held.

He didn't die.

But he could feel the map slipping.

At eight minutes, the gold deficit grew.

The crowd's noise shifted.

Less belief.

More anticipation of collapse.

Enzo's jaw clenched.

He glanced quickly at the audience beyond stage lights.

He couldn't see faces clearly.

But he felt the weight of them.

Then Rangga's voice came low.

"We need one pick," Rangga said. "One mistake. We punish."

Bayu's breath was loud in the mic. "They won't."

Enzo stared at the minimap.

He watched Saigon's rotations.

He waited.

Then he saw it.

Saigon's roamer lingered too long near mid bush.

A half-second greed.

A moment of confidence.

Enzo's heart kicked.

"Roam mid," he said quietly. "He's alone."

Rangga hesitated.

Then, calm: "Go."

Enzo rotated.

Bayu followed.

Fikri moved.

They collapsed.

The pick was clean.

The crowd roared with surprise.

Saigon responded instantly--rotating to punish.

But Kuda Hitam didn't chase.

They took tower.

They took map space.

They breathed.

Ugly.

But breathing.

At twelve minutes, Saigon started lord.

They wanted to end.

Kuda Hitam hovered.

Bayu's voice rose. "We fight."

Rangga's voice was tight. "We have to."

Enzo's palms were damp.

He moved through fog, searching for angle.

He found it.

Not perfect.

But possible.

"Wait," Enzo said. "Let them commit. Then I go backline."

Rangga's voice snapped. "Okay."

They waited.

Lord's health dropped.

Saigon committed.

Enzo dove.

He hit the backline.

Stun landed.

Adit's damage followed.

Rangga engaged front.

Bayu tried to secure.

For one heartbeat, it looked like a comeback.

Then Saigon's mid turned on Enzo.

A burst.

Enzo's health vanished.

He died.

The screen went gray.

His heart dropped.

Adit screamed something.

Bayu cursed.

Rangga's voice went sharp. "Back! Back!"

They retreated.

Saigon secured lord.

The crowd's roar shifted--satisfied.

Enzo's chest felt hollow.

He stared at his respawn timer.

This was it.

They were going to lose.

They were going to go home.

The story would be:

**Kuda Hitam collapses. Distractions win.**

Enzo's hands clenched.

Then, in the grayness of death screen, his eyes flicked to the crowd again.

A small corner.

Near the aisle.

A figure stood.

Cap.

Mask.

Hijab tucked beneath.

She wasn't waving.

She wasn't screaming.

She wasn't making content.

She was just there--hands clasped tight around a folded poster pressed against her chest like a secret.

Enzo's breath caught.

Mira.

Or maybe he was imagining her.

But the way she held herself--careful, watched--was too real to be a hallucination.

Her eyes met the stage for a fraction of a second.

And even from far away, Enzo felt the message.

I'm here.

His respawn timer ticked down.

Ten.

Nine.

Enzo's throat tightened.

His hands stopped trembling.

Not because he wasn't afraid.

Because the fear had somewhere to go.

He whispered under his breath, so softly only he could hear.

"Okay."

He respawned.

Saigon pushed with lord.

Their gold lead was big.

Their momentum was brutal.

But their formation--

It was tight.

Too tight.

Enzo saw it.

The same greed as earlier.

They wanted to end quickly.

They were confident.

Bayu's voice was hoarse. "We defend. Last."

Rangga's voice held. "We defend. We don't panic."

Adit's breathing was loud.

Enzo's voice came calm.

"Hold skills," he said quietly. "Don't blow everything on lord. We kill their carry."

Silence.

Then Rangga, tight: "Okay."

They defended.

First wave.

They cleared.

Second wave.

Saigon overstepped.

Enzo waited.

Waited.

Then he went.

A flank from side bush.

Stun.

Burst.

Saigon's carry fell.

The crowd roared.

Saigon panicked for the first time.

They tried to reset.

Kuda Hitam chased--but not for kills.

For map.

They cleared lord.

They pushed mid.

They took back space.

It wasn't a miracle.

It was a theft.

Ugly.

Desperate.

Necessary.

At twenty minutes, the gold was still behind.

But the map had shifted.

Saigon made a mistake.

A rushed lord start.

A bad entry.

Bayu secured the steal.

Adit screamed.

Rangga's voice cracked, "GO! GO! GO!"

Enzo's hands moved.

They pushed.

They broke inhibitors.

The crowd rose.

Saigon tried to defend.

Their formation broke.

Enzo hit the backline again.

Adit cleaned.

Bayu dove.

Rangga controlled.

The enemy core fell.

Victory.

The screen flashed.

For a second, Enzo didn't believe it.

His headset muffled the crowd, but he could still hear the roar through vibration, through the stage floor, through the blood in his ears.

Bayu shouted something that sounded like a sob and a laugh together.

Adit's hands were shaking as he ripped his headset off.

Rangga leaned back in his chair, eyes squeezed shut for one second.

Fikri exhaled like his lungs had been holding a stone.

Tia stood off-stage.

Her hand covered her mouth.

Her eyes were wet.

She didn't let the tears fall.

Not yet.

Enzo stood for the handshake line.

His legs felt unreal.

His hands were still moving even when the match was over.

Saigon Mirage's captain shook his hand, expression tight.

"Good defense," he said in accented English.

Enzo nodded.

His mouth was dry.

"Thanks," he whispered.

He walked off stage.

And as he passed the edge of the crowd barrier, he glanced toward the aisle.

The figure in cap and mask was gone.

No poster.

No eyes.

Just empty air.

Enzo's chest tightened.

Had she been real?

Or had desperation painted her into existence?

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

He pulled it out.

A message.

**MiraCheng:** i was there. i had to leave. you did it.

Enzo's throat tightened.

He stared at the words until his vision blurred.

He typed with shaking fingers.

**Enzo:** i saw you

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'm sorry. i'm not supposed to be

Enzo's chest tightened.

Not supposed.

Like her presence was a crime.

He typed:

**Enzo:** thank you

A pause.

Then Mira replied:

**MiraCheng:** now… ten minutes. right?

Enzo froze.

Ten minutes.

The meeting.

He looked up.

Tia stood at the corridor entrance, eyes fixed on him.

She held the Cheng Group folder.

Her face was composed.

Her gaze said everything.

It's time.

Enzo's stomach dropped.

He slipped his phone into his pocket and followed.

As they walked toward the sponsor lounge, the roar of the arena faded behind them.

The hallway grew quieter.

Cleaner.

Smaller.

A different kind of battlefield.

Enzo's fingers curled around the green-dot keychain in his pocket.

He felt the smooth plastic press into his palm.

Online.

Still.

But now the dot didn't feel like comfort.

It felt like a target.

Tia paused outside a door marked **VIP LOUNGE**.

She looked at Enzo.

"Remember," she said quietly. "Don't promise. Don't sign. Don't agree. You say you need time. You say you need your manager."

Enzo swallowed.

"Okay," he whispered.

Tia nodded once.

Then she opened the door.

Warm light spilled out.

A soft scent of expensive perfume.

The sound of polite laughter.

And somewhere inside, Enzo knew, sat the kind of people who could buy narratives like they bought handbags.

He stepped forward.

And the door closed behind him.
