Enzo woke to a rectangle of light on his pillow.

For a moment, his brain didn't know where he was. The ceiling above him looked too close. The air felt heavy, as if the night had never fully left the room. His phone vibrated again, the cheap plastic buzzing against thin cotton.

A message.

He blinked hard, the edges of sleep scraping at his eyes, then rolled over and grabbed the device.

**MiraCheng:** u awake?

Enzo stared at the words until they sharpened.

He glanced at the clock.

11:46 a.m.

He'd slept like he'd been hit. Six hours, maybe. Not enough, but more than usual.

His mother's voice drifted from the kitchen--pots clinking, water running. The smell of garlic and something fried hung in the corridor. His stomach tightened, not with hunger, but with the familiar dread of being discovered in the wrong kind of life.

He typed back, thumbs still clumsy.

**Enzo:** just woke

A second later, three dots appeared.

**MiraCheng:** good. eat first

He almost laughed. It was such a small sentence, but it landed like a hand on his shoulder. Like someone had looked past the scoreboard and saw the person sitting in a cramped room with an aging fan and a bed that squeaked.

Enzo pushed himself upright. The room swayed slightly; his body felt as if it was still half on the battlefield. He rubbed his face, then typed.

**Enzo:** you ate?

The reply took longer.

Three dots.

Gone.

Three dots again.

**MiraCheng:** later

Enzo frowned.

It wasn't unusual. Everyone who played late nights lived in some kind of schedule that didn't fit the sun. But there had been something in her voice last night--tired, careful--that made "later" sound less like a casual delay and more like a promise she wasn't sure she could keep.

He typed, then hesitated, erased, typed again.

**Enzo:** don't forget

The three dots appeared almost immediately.

**MiraCheng:** okay :)

The smiley face should have felt childish.

Instead, Enzo stared at it like it meant something complicated.

***

He washed up quickly in the tiny bathroom, careful not to let the tap squeal too loudly. The mirror was speckled with water stains and age. His face looked older than twenty-two when he was sleep-starved--hollows under his eyes, hair flattened on one side, lips pressed as if he was perpetually bracing.

When he stepped out, his mother was at the stove.

"Gising ka na," she said without turning, voice mild but edged with awareness. You're awake.

Enzo hummed.

She glanced over her shoulder, eyes narrowing slightly. "Late ka na naman natulog?"

He shrugged, reaching for a plate. "Hindi naman." Not really.

A lie, but a soft one.

His mother didn't push. She never did. She was too tired for fights that didn't pay rent.

"May delivery ka mamaya?" she asked.

"Afternoon," Enzo said.

She nodded, sliding fried eggs onto a plate. "Kumain ka. Wag puro laro." Eat. Don't just play.

Enzo's fingers tightened around the edge of the table.

His mother didn't know what "play" meant to him. She thought it was waste--bright colors on a screen that stole his attention, that stole his life.

Maybe she wasn't wrong.

But last night, for the first time in weeks, the game had felt like something else.

It had felt like being understood.

Enzo ate quickly, then retreated to his room before his mother could ask questions that might crack him open.

He lay back on his bed and stared at his ceiling again.

He told himself he wasn't obsessed.

He told himself it was just a duo partner.

A good one.

But when his phone buzzed again, his heart still kicked like it wanted out.

**MiraCheng:** can we call later?

Enzo swallowed.

He typed:

**Enzo:** sure

Then he added:

**Enzo:** what time for you?

This time, her reply came with an audio note.

He hesitated, thumb hovering, then pressed play.

Her voice spilled into his ear--clear, warm, slightly hushed.

"Maybe… after Maghrib," she said. The word rolled soft and sure. "I have things with family first."

Maghrib.

Enzo's brows drew together.

Prayer.

He'd grown up around Muslims--neighbors, classmates, the old man who ran the sari-sari store down the street--but the rhythm of prayer times had always been background to him, something that belonged to other people's lives.

The way she said it made it feel central.

Enzo typed carefully.

**Enzo:** okay. msg me when you're free

The three dots appeared.

**MiraCheng:** i will

Then, as if she couldn't help adding a smaller truth beneath it:

**MiraCheng:** don't disappear

Enzo's throat tightened.

He stared at the message until the words felt like they were pressing against his ribs.

**Enzo:** i won't

He hit send before he could overthink.

***

On the other side of the sea, Nadzira Cheng closed her phone and rested her forehead against cool marble.

The hallway of her family home was bright even in midday--sunlight filtered through tall windows, diffused by expensive curtains that never moved because the air-conditioning was always on. Everything was clean and polished and quiet in a way that made her feel like she was always being listened to.

She could hear her mother's voice downstairs, crisp and musical, speaking to someone on the phone. She could hear her aunt laughing. She could hear the faint clink of cups.

Her family's life was a stage even without cameras.

Zira exhaled slowly and adjusted her inner scarf, fingers smoothing fabric at the base of her neck. The mirror at the end of the hallway reflected her in fragments--carefully applied makeup, a soft pink lip, brows shaped just enough to look effortless. She wore a modest blouse with long sleeves that cost more than most people's rent.

She didn't choose it.

It was chosen for her.

"Zira!"

Her mother's voice snapped up the stairs like a hook.

Zira forced her posture straight, then walked down with measured steps.

The living room was arranged like an editorial spread--cream sofas, gold accents, a vase of fresh flowers that always looked like it had been placed there five minutes ago. Her mother sat at the center, phone in hand, smile sharp enough to cut glass.

"Darling," her mother said, the same tone she used on live streams, the same tone she used when she wanted the world to believe they were a perfect family. "Come. Say hi to Auntie Lina."

Zira leaned down and kissed her aunt's cheek.

Auntie Lina looked her over, gaze lingering the way older relatives did, as if they were assessing a product's quality. "Cantik sekali," she said. So pretty.

Zira smiled politely.

"Your brand manager will come at three," her mother said, switching languages mid-sentence like it was nothing. "We have the skincare shoot tomorrow. And there's the charity gala this weekend. Don't forget the speech."

Zira's smile didn't move.

Inside, something tightened.

"Yes, Ma," she said.

Her mother's eyes narrowed slightly, catching the smallest shift in her face. "Don't look so tired. You need to sleep earlier."

Zira's throat worked.

Sleep earlier.

So her day could become theirs.

"So," Auntie Lina said brightly, "I saw your live yesterday! The outfit was so--what do you call it? Very… Korean."

Zira nodded, smile still fixed.

Her mother leaned in, voice lowering just enough to be private. "Also, about your… gaming thing."

Zira's heart dipped.

Her mother never said gaming like it was neutral. She said it like it was a weird habit she tolerated because it made Zira seem 'relatable.'

"I told you," her mother continued, "keep it clean. No boy drama. No rumors. You're a Muslim girl. People love you because you are… proper."

Proper.

The word felt like a collar.

Zira's nails pressed gently into her palm.

"Yes, Ma," she said again.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

Not loud. Not enough for the others to notice.

But Zira felt it like a pulse.

A green dot somewhere in the world.

***

Enzo's afternoon was a blur of Manila heat.

He delivered food on a battered motorcycle that wasn't really his--borrowed, paid off slowly in favors and awkward agreements. Sweat soaked his shirt within minutes. The city smelled of exhaust, fried oil, rain that never quite cooled the pavement.

Between deliveries, he checked his phone.

No new message.

He told himself not to care.

He checked again anyway.

At a red light, his friend Marco texted him in their group chat.

**Marco:** bro tonight scrim? may bagong team sa discord

Enzo's thumb hovered.

Scrims meant stronger players. Less chaos. More structure.

It also meant being seen.

Enzo typed:

**Enzo:** maybe later

Marco replied instantly.

**Marco:** sabihin mo na. ikaw lang yung exp na di nagpapakamatay

Enzo snorted softly. He turned the bike as the light went green, merging into traffic like a fish slipping into darker water.

At the end of his shift, his arms ached and his eyes felt gritty. He brought home a plastic bag of leftover bread from the bakery and handed it to his mother.

She looked surprised, then softened.

"Salamat," she said.

Enzo nodded, avoiding her eyes. He went into his room, shut the door, and sat on his bed.

The ceiling fan rattled.

His phone screen glowed.

No message.

He exhaled.

He told himself she was busy.

That her life was not a cramped room in Manila.

That she probably lived in a high-rise with a view.

Then the notification finally came.

**MiraCheng:** free now. can call?

Enzo's fingers moved before his brain could catch up.

He plugged in his headset.

He accepted.

Her voice arrived like it had been waiting behind a door.

"Hey," she said softly.

"Hey," Enzo replied.

A pause.

He heard faint background noise--cutlery, distant voices, maybe a television. Her environment sounded big. Open. Not cramped like his.

"You ate?" Enzo asked.

A small laugh. "I did. Finally."

"Good."

Silence again.

Enzo didn't know how to fill it without making it awkward. He wasn't used to talking to girls like this. He wasn't used to talking to anyone like this.

Mira spoke first. "How was your day?"

Enzo shrugged, even though she couldn't see it. "Work. Delivery."

"You do delivery?"

"Yeah."

He waited for the pity.

It didn't come.

Instead, Mira said, "That's… tiring. Be careful on the road, okay?"

Enzo's throat tightened.

"Okay," he murmured.

Her breath hit the mic, a soft sound like she had smiled. "You sound sleepy."

"I'm fine."

"Liar."

Enzo blinked, surprised.

Her tone wasn't accusatory.

It was… affectionate.

He didn't know what to do with that.

He changed the subject like a coward. "You said after Maghrib. You prayed?"

Mira went quiet for a second.

"Yes," she said. "I… had to."

The way she said it wasn't about obligation.

It was about survival.

Enzo swallowed. "Is it… hard?"

"Praying?"

"Living like… proper."

He didn't know why he said it.

Maybe because he remembered her mother's voice in that audio note--family first.

Maybe because her voice, right now, sounded like she was balancing something heavy.

Mira didn't answer immediately.

When she did, her voice was quieter. "People think I'm proper because of what I show."

Enzo listened, still.

"They don't know how messy my head is," Mira continued. "They don't know I stay up at night just to feel like… I'm mine."

Enzo's fingers tightened around his phone.

He wanted to tell her he understood.

But his life was different.

His cage was poverty. Hers sounded like gold.

He didn't know which was worse.

Before he could respond, Mira's voice shifted suddenly.

"Hold on."

A muffled movement. Footsteps.

Then--another voice, sharp and bright, cut through the mic.

"Zira, kamu sudah siap belum? Brand manager sudah sampai!"

Zira.

Enzo froze.

The name wasn't Mira.

It sounded like something real.

Mira--Zira--made a small sound, like she'd been caught. "Iya, Ma. Sebentar."

Her mother.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He heard Mira's breathing, closer to the mic now.

"Sorry," she whispered. Her voice was suddenly lower, more urgent. "I need to go downstairs."

"Okay," Enzo said quickly. "It's fine."

"Wait," Mira said, then hesitated. "Don't--don't hang up yet. Just… stay."

Enzo stared at the wall in front of him.

"Stay?" he repeated softly.

"I'll mute," she said. "Just… I like knowing you're there."

Something in his chest tightened and warmed at the same time.

"Okay," Enzo said.

He listened as she muted.

The line didn't go dead.

He could still hear faint movement through the mic--fabric, footsteps, distant conversation. He imagined her walking into a room filled with people who expected her to be one version of herself.

Enzo sat very still.

He felt like he was holding a secret in his hands.

***

On the other side, Zira descended the stairs with her phone hidden in her hand.

She kept her face calm.

She had done this a thousand times.

The brand manager sat in the living room beside her mother. A woman in her thirties, sleek ponytail, tablet already open. Zira recognized the expression: friendly, efficient, predatory.

"Zira!" the woman said brightly. "You look gorgeous. Okay, we need to review the deliverables."

Zira nodded, taking the seat her mother indicated.

Her phone buzzed against her thigh.

Not a notification.

Just the warmth of being connected.

Her mother's gaze flicked down--so quick most people wouldn't notice.

But Zira noticed.

Her mother had trained her to notice.

"Deliverable one," the manager said, "is the skincare set. We want an unboxing, a morning routine, and a short 'before & after'--but remember, no heavy filters. Authentic is the trend."

Authentic.

Zira kept her smile.

Her mother leaned in and added, "And no gaming content next week. We have the gala. You'll be seated with Pak Hendra and his wife. It's important."

Zira's stomach dropped.

Pak Hendra.

A name her mother used like a warning.

Her mother continued, voice smooth. "Also, there's talk online. Some fans think you're… interacting with male gamers."

Zira's heartbeat stumbled.

She held her smile like it was glued on.

"It's just games," she said lightly.

Her mother's eyes sharpened. "Games become rumors. Rumors become headlines. Headlines become problems."

Zira's phone felt like a coal in her hand.

She imagined the green dot.

She imagined Enzo sitting somewhere in the Philippines, in a room that probably looked nothing like hers, waiting quietly because she asked him to.

Her mother's voice continued, gentle but cold. "You're not like other girls, Zira. You have a responsibility. A Muslim girl with your platform must be careful."

Zira nodded.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

She was fluent in obedience.

But inside, something pressed against the walls.

Because for the first time, there was something she wanted that wasn't already planned.

***

Enzo waited.

Minutes stretched.

He didn't know what he was waiting for, exactly. Not her voice--he could live without it. Not the game--they hadn't queued. He was waiting for proof that he hadn't imagined the intimacy of last night.

His headset hummed faintly.

In the silence, he heard his own world: a neighbor's laughter, someone's karaoke, the distant honk of traffic.

Then Mira unmuted.

Her voice returned--different.

Still soft, but tight.

"Sorry," she said, breathless. "I'm back."

Enzo sat up straighter. "Are you okay?"

A pause.

"I'm fine."

He heard the lie this time.

"Want to play?" he asked, giving her an escape.

"Yeah," Mira said quickly, as if she needed something to hold on to. "Let's play."

They queued.

The match loaded.

For the first few minutes, Mira's gameplay was sharp as always. But Enzo noticed the small things: the delayed rotation, the hesitation before committing to a fight, the way she typed "sry" once when she missed a skill.

Mira didn't apologize in game.

Something had rattled her.

Enzo didn't comment.

Instead, he adapted.

He covered her lane when she needed to reset. He took fights only when he was sure she could follow. He kept his voice calm.

"Wait," he said softly during a turtle contest. "Don't go yet."

Mira exhaled. "Okay."

Her "okay" sounded like relief.

They won.

But the win didn't feel like the one last night.

It felt like holding something fragile.

Between matches, Mira went quiet.

Enzo hesitated, then asked, "That voice earlier… your mom?"

A long pause.

"Yes," Mira said.

"You said… Zira."

Another pause.

"That's my name," she admitted, as if giving it away cost her. "Nadzira. But… I don't use it online."

Enzo's chest tightened.

He imagined writing it in his mind like a secret.

"Nadzira," he repeated, softly testing the shape.

Mira's breath caught. "Don't say it too much."

Enzo frowned. "Why?"

"Because it becomes real," she whispered.

Enzo didn't know how to respond to that. Real was the thing he'd been avoiding his entire life.

"Do you want me to call you Mira?" he asked.

Mira's laugh came out small and strained. "Mira is… safe."

Enzo nodded, even though she couldn't see.

"Okay," he said. "Mira."

The line went quiet.

Then Mira said softly, "Can I see you?"

Enzo froze.

Video call.

His room was a mess. His walls were stained. His bed sheet was thin. He didn't want her to see the poverty like it was a confession.

"I look bad," he said quickly.

Mira's voice softened. "So do I."

Enzo almost laughed. He didn't believe her.

"You're an influencer," he said.

A beat.

Mira didn't deny it.

Instead, she said, "Enzo… please."

He stared at his cracked phone screen.

He didn't know when he'd told her his real name.

He didn't remember offering it.

But somehow, she had it.

And hearing it from her mouth felt like being seen.

He tapped.

The camera switched.

For a moment, the screen showed his face--tired eyes, messy hair, skin damp with Manila humidity.

Then her feed loaded.

Enzo's breath caught.

She was sitting in a room that looked like a hotel even though it probably wasn't--soft lighting, clean walls, a faint blur of a decorative shelf behind her. She wore a simple hijab in a muted shade, pinned neatly. Her makeup was minimal, but her features were striking--high cheekbones, eyes that looked like they'd learned how to smile without surrendering.

She was beautiful.

Not in an internet way.

In a human way that made Enzo suddenly aware of his own posture, his own background, his own breath.

Mira's eyes flicked over him, then softened.

"You're real," she murmured.

Enzo's throat tightened. "So are you."

Mira's lips curved, small. "I'm always real. People just… choose which parts they want to see."

Enzo swallowed.

He wanted to ask how many people had looked at her and still not seen her.

But before he could speak, a notification popped up on his screen.

A friend request.

A message.

From a name he didn't recognize.

**Tryout_Admin:** saw you in ranked. scrim later? serious.

Enzo stared.

His heart kicked.

Mira noticed his shift.

"What?" she asked.

Enzo hesitated.

He didn't want to say it.

Not yet.

Because if he said it, it might become real.

"It's… nothing," he lied.

Mira's eyes narrowed slightly, not angry--just perceptive. "Enzo."

He exhaled.

"A message," he admitted. "From someone. They want scrims."

Mira's gaze held his.

"Is that good?" she asked.

Enzo's fingers tightened around the phone.

He thought of his room.

He thought of his mother's tired hands.

He thought of the way the game had felt like flying last night.

"I don't know," he said honestly. "But… maybe."

Mira's eyes softened.

"Maybe is how things start," she said.

Enzo swallowed.

On the screen, her face was calm, but he saw the tension at the corners of her mouth--the quiet fear of consequences.

"Will your… family be okay with it?" he asked, surprising himself.

Mira's smile flickered.

"My family is okay with things," she said carefully, "as long as they can control the story."

Enzo stared.

Control.

He knew what it felt like to have no control.

He didn't know what it felt like to have too much.

Mira lifted her hand slightly, as if she wanted to reach through the screen.

"Just promise me," she said softly.

Enzo's chest tightened.

"Promise what?" he asked.

Mira's voice dropped, almost a whisper.

"If the world finds you… don't let them turn you into something you're not."

Enzo's throat worked.

He didn't know how to promise that.

But he could promise something smaller.

"I'll try," he said.

Mira nodded, as if that was enough.

Then, quietly, she said, "And… don't disappear."

Enzo held her gaze.

"I won't," he said again.

He didn't see, yet, how those words would one day be tested by more than distance.

How money and PR and family expectations could reach through a screen like a hand around a throat.

But for now, Mira's video feed stayed.

Her eyes stayed.

And the green dot beside her name glowed like a small, stubborn miracle.

On Enzo's screen, the unknown message waited.

Scrim later?

Serious.

Enzo looked at Mira--Nadzira--then back at the message.

He felt the future tilt toward him, heavy and bright.

"Okay," he whispered, though he wasn't sure if he was answering the tryout invite or the girl on the screen.

Mira smiled faintly.

"Okay," she echoed.

And somewhere in a clean house in Jakarta and a cramped room in Manila, two lives--both borrowed, both controlled in different ways--leaned, just a little, toward something chosen.
