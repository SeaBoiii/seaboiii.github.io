Title: First Meeting, Off-Camera
novel: lower-bracket-lovers
order: 4
---

The departure hall smelled like metal, coffee, and anticipation.

Enzo had always imagined airports as places for people with plans. People with matching luggage. People who knew where they were going and what they would become when they arrived.

He stood in line with a backpack that had seen better years, the strap frayed where it rubbed his shoulder, and a small carry-on borrowed from Tito Ramon. The wheels didn't roll smoothly; they wobbled in protest every time he tried to push it straight.

His passport felt heavier than paper should.

He kept checking it, as if it might vanish.

At the check-in counter, a clerk asked a question in English. Enzo answered automatically, his voice steady even as his palms dampened. When the clerk slid his boarding pass back to him, the thin card might as well have been a ticket into another life.

He stepped aside and stared at the printed destination.

**JAKARTA.**

It looked unreal.

His phone buzzed.

A message from Mira.

**MiraCheng:** safe flight. send me your landing time.

Enzo read it twice. He should have smiled.

Instead, his chest tightened.

He hadn't told her his flight details. Not because he didn't trust her--because he trusted her too much. There was a part of him that wanted to keep something untouched by this new world, something that wasn't immediately exposed to the internet's hunger.

He typed back anyway.

**Enzo:** landing 2:10pm. i'll msg when i'm through

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'll be online

Online.

The green dot again--always that tiny signal, a small stubborn proof.

Enzo slid his phone into his pocket, then turned and searched for his mother.

She stood near the gate, hands clasped in front of her. She wore a plain blouse and the same old tote bag she carried to work, as if insisting that even in an airport she would not be dressed by someone else's expectations.

When Enzo approached, she didn't hug him immediately.

She looked him over first.

As if checking for injuries.

As if checking for sincerity.

"May pagkain ka?" she asked.

Enzo blinked. "What?"

"Food," she repeated, more sharply. "You have food?"

Enzo patted his backpack and nodded. "Bread. Water."

His mother's mouth tightened, then softened. "And contract?"

Enzo pulled out his folder--printed contract, photocopies of his ID, Tito Ramon's scribbled notes. His mother nodded, as if reassured by paper.

She reached out then, fingers pressing briefly against his forearm. Her hands were warm and rough from years of work.

"Call me when you land," she said.

"I will."

"And if something is wrong--if they don't give you room, if they ask money--leave."

Enzo's throat tightened. "Okay."

His mother's eyes held his.

"You're brave," she said quietly.

Enzo's breath caught.

His mother rarely used words like that. Praise was a luxury in their home, something saved for emergencies.

"Ma--" he began.

She shook her head, as if cutting off sentiment before it could drown her. "Don't be stupid brave. Be smart brave."

Enzo let out a small, wet laugh.

His mother's eyes shone, but she didn't cry.

She stepped back, adjusting her tote strap like she was preparing herself for the emptiness he would leave behind. "Go," she said.

Enzo nodded.

He turned.

Then he turned back one more time, because parting always felt unfinished.

His mother lifted her hand in a small wave.

Enzo swallowed and walked toward the gate.

He didn't look back again.

He was afraid if he did, he would stay.

***

The plane rose through a layer of cloud that looked like cotton and then abruptly like nothing--just pale sunlight, endless sky.

Enzo stared out the window and tried to make his thoughts behave.

He should have been excited.

He was.

But the excitement was threaded with fear.

What if the team regretted signing him? What if he was just a ranked demon who collapsed under offline pressure? What if his Tagalog slipped into English at the wrong time and made him sound stupid? What if he arrived and the bootcamp was worse than they'd admitted? What if the tournament was an illusion and this was all just an expensive joke?

And then there was Mira.

Or Zira.

He pictured her face in the soft light of her video call, the clean background that made his room look even smaller, the tension that lived beneath her calm.

When he'd asked if she wanted to meet, she'd said yes.

Yes.

The word had followed him through packing, through security, through his mother's warnings.

Now, as the plane leveled, the thought settled in his chest with a strange weight.

He was going to be in the same country.

Same air.

Same time zone.

No screens.

No mute button.

No easy escape.

His phone, in airplane mode, lay dark on his lap.

For the first time since he met her, there was no green dot.

He felt its absence like the quiet after a song ends.

***

Jakarta hit him like a hand on the back.

Not violent, not cruel--just immediate.

The moment he stepped out of the terminal, the air wrapped around him, thick with humidity and the smell of exhaust and something faintly sweet, like fried dough from a cart somewhere nearby. It felt different from Manila's heat. Manila's heat was loud and gritty, a constant assault.

Jakarta's heat was heavy, patient, as if it had all the time in the world.

Enzo stood near the arrival area with his carry-on beside him, watching families reunite, watching men in crisp shirts hold signs with names, watching tourists look lost with expensive cameras.

He checked his phone.

No signal.

Then a bar.

Then two.

Notifications poured in like they'd been holding their breath.

A WhatsApp message from Tia.

**TiaManager:** Welcome. You out?

Enzo typed quickly.

**Enzo:** yes. at arrivals

A reply.

**TiaManager:** Wait by Gate 3. Driver pick you.

Enzo glanced around until he found a sign: Gate 3.

He moved there, dragging his wobbling suitcase. The wheels clicked over uneven tile.

As he waited, his phone buzzed again.

Mira.

**MiraCheng:** landed?

Enzo exhaled.

The green dot would come soon, he thought. It always did.

He typed.

**Enzo:** landed. it's hot.

A second later:

**MiraCheng:** haha welcome to jakarta

Then:

**MiraCheng:** are you okay?

Enzo's throat tightened at the simplicity of the question.

**Enzo:** i'm okay. waiting for driver

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** proud of you

Enzo stared.

Pride again.

He swallowed and locked his phone.

A man approached with a cardboard sign.

**ENZO REYES -- KHE**

The sign looked like someone had written it quickly with a marker that was running out of ink.

For some reason, that made Enzo's chest ease.

Not corporate.

Not polished.

Real.

The driver smiled. "Enzo? Filipino?"

"Yes," Enzo replied.

"Come," the driver said. "Traffic… always."

Enzo followed him to the parking area.

The car was older, the upholstery cracked. It smelled faintly of cigarettes and lemon freshener. The driver loaded Enzo's luggage with a grunt.

As they pulled into the main road, Jakarta unfolded.

It was not the sleek city from influencer vlogs.

It was a sprawl--flyovers, endless motorcycles swarming like schools of fish, billboards stacked on billboards, graffiti on concrete, towers rising in the distance like promises.

The driver navigated with practiced impatience, horns blaring in a language Enzo didn't understand but somehow did.

Enzo watched the city slide past and tried not to think about how small he was in it.

His phone buzzed.

Tia again.

**TiaManager:** Bootcamp in West Jakarta. Simple. You okay with simple?

Enzo almost laughed.

**Enzo:** i'm from manila. simple ok

Tia replied with a single emoji.

👍

Enzo leaned back, letting the car's vibration numb his nerves.

He thought of Mira--Zira--in her clean house, her mother's sharp voice.

He wondered what "simple" meant to her.

***

The bootcamp was not in a high-rise.

It was in a low apartment building tucked between a laundry shop and a warung with plastic stools. The stairwell smelled like damp concrete and fried tempeh. The hallway light flickered on and off like a tired eyelid.

Enzo followed the driver up two flights.

On the third floor, a metal gate stood in front of a door.

The driver knocked.

It opened after a moment.

Tia stood there.

In photos, she might have looked intimidating--sharp eyeliner, straight posture, expression that said she didn't have time.

In person, she looked… tired.

Not weak.

Tired like someone who carried a team on her back.

"Enzo," she said, voice brisk. "Welcome."

Enzo nodded awkwardly. "Hi."

Tia stepped aside. "Come in. Shoes off."

Enzo slipped his shoes off at the entrance.

The apartment was cramped but functional.

Two small bedrooms. A living room converted into a scrim area with mismatched desks. Cables like vines across the floor. A couch with a torn armrest. A whiteboard with draft notes scribbled in black marker.

Someone had taped a paper sign above the scrim area:

**NO TILT. NO EXCUSES.**

Enzo's chest tightened.

Bayu was at one of the desks, headphones around his neck, eyes sharp as he looked Enzo over.

Adit sat slouched, scrolling through his phone, but his gaze flicked up with curiosity.

Rangga stood near the kitchen, holding a cup of instant coffee like it was a lifeline.

Fikri--Enzo recognized him from the scrims--gave a small nod.

The room felt like a pack assessing a new animal.

Tia clapped once, crisp. "Okay. This is Enzo. From Manila. EXP main. Flex. He will bootcamp with us until tournament."

Bayu snorted. "If he survives."

Adit grinned. "If traffic doesn't kill him first."

Enzo forced a smile.

He didn't know how to be friendly here. In Manila, humor was often armor.

In this room, humor felt like a test.

Rangga stepped forward, offering his hand. "Rangga," he said.

Enzo shook it. Rangga's grip was firm.

"Bayu," Bayu said without offering his hand.

Enzo nodded.

"Adit," Adit said, flashing a grin that looked easy but didn't reach his eyes.

"Fikri," Fikri said softly.

Tia gestured to a small corner of the living room. "Your bed is there. We don't have extra room. Sorry."

Enzo looked.

A thin mattress on the floor. A pillow. A folded blanket.

It was not worse than home.

It was just different.

"Okay," Enzo said.

Tia's gaze lingered on his face, as if expecting complaint.

When none came, something loosened in her expression.

"Good," she said. "We scrim in one hour. You rest, shower."

Enzo nodded.

He dragged his suitcase into the corner and sat on the mattress.

The apartment's sounds filled his ears--fans buzzing, keyboard clicks, distant motorbikes outside.

He felt oddly calm.

This place was messy.

But it was real.

He pulled out his phone.

Mira's green dot blinked on.

Online.

Enzo stared at it, then typed.

**Enzo:** i'm at bootcamp

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** how is it?

Enzo hesitated.

He didn't want to complain.

He didn't want to sound amazed at things she might consider normal.

He typed anyway.

**Enzo:** small. messy. but… real

The reply came quickly.

**MiraCheng:** good. small teams fight harder

Then:

**MiraCheng:** when can we meet?

Enzo's heart kicked.

He stared at the message until his thumbs felt too heavy.

Meet.

He glanced around the apartment.

Bayu was arguing with Adit about some draft.

Rangga was drawing circles on the whiteboard.

Tia was on the phone, voice low and urgent.

No one was looking at Enzo.

He typed.

**Enzo:** i don't know your schedule

A pause.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** tonight?

Enzo's breath caught.

Tonight.

He was still wearing his travel clothes.

He hadn't even unpacked.

He hadn't even proven himself to this team.

And yet his chest warmed.

He typed carefully.

**Enzo:** i have scrims tonight

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** after

Enzo swallowed.

He didn't know if he should.

He didn't know if he was allowed to want that.

Then Mira sent another message.

**MiraCheng:** not long. just… see you

Enzo stared.

Just see you.

He thought of her mother's warning--rumors become headlines.

He thought of his mother's warning--leave if wrong.

He thought of the green dot.

Online.

Always.

He typed.

**Enzo:** okay. where?

The reply came with a pin.

A location.

A quiet café in a mall not too far from West Jakarta.

Enzo read the name twice.

Then Mira added:

**MiraCheng:** wear cap. no jersey.

Enzo almost smiled.

Even now, she was strategizing.

He typed:

**Enzo:** okay

Then he paused, thumb hovering.

He added:

**Enzo:** i'm nervous

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** me too

Two simple words.

And suddenly, the fear felt shared.

***

Scrims began at six.

The room shifted into a different energy--focused, tense, ritualistic. Bayu put his headset on and became someone sharper. Adit sat up straighter, jaw set. Rangga's voice calmed, turning into a metronome of calls.

Enzo slid into the EXP position.

He took a breath.

"Okay," Rangga said in English, for him. "We play disciplined. Enzo, you call if you see macro."

Bayu grunted. "Don't be scared, import."

Enzo didn't answer.

He stared at the draft.

In the first match, they lost.

Not because Enzo fed, not because his mechanics failed.

Because he was a half-second late to understand the rhythm of their comms.

Indonesian words flew--rotasi, lord, atas, bawah.

Enzo translated in his head as fast as he could, but the map didn't wait for language.

They got punished.

Bayu slammed his hand on the desk. "See? Communication!"

Tia's voice snapped. "Enough. One game. Again."

Enzo's stomach dipped.

He wasn't used to being the weak link.

In ranked, he was the stable one.

Here, he was the foreign piece that had to fit.

He inhaled.

On the second scrim, he adjusted.

He watched the minimap harder than the fight.

He listened for patterns in their calls.

He stopped trying to translate every word and instead followed the tone.

When Rangga's voice tightened, it meant fight.

When Fikri's voice went quiet, it meant danger.

When Bayu's voice rose, it meant he was about to overforce.

Enzo began to anticipate.

He typed short English in chat when needed.

**wait. trade tower.

don't fight. reset.

shadow me.

lord timing.**

They started winning small trades.

Then bigger ones.

By the fourth scrim, Bayu stopped complaining.

By the fifth, Adit began listening.

By the sixth, Rangga's voice held something like satisfaction.

"Good," Rangga said. "Better."

Enzo exhaled, sweat dampening his palms.

When scrims ended, it was already late.

The apartment smelled like instant noodles and fatigue.

Bayu stretched, cracking his neck. "We eat. Sleep."

Tia looked at Enzo. "You okay?"

Enzo nodded. "Yes."

Tia's gaze lingered. She didn't ask more.

Maybe she didn't want to know.

Enzo went into the tiny bathroom, splashed water on his face, then stared at himself in the mirror.

His eyes looked brighter than they had in weeks.

Not because he was less tired.

Because he was moving toward something.

He changed into a plain black t-shirt and jeans. He borrowed a cap from Rangga--too big, but better than nothing.

When he stepped out, Bayu raised an eyebrow.

"Where you go?" Bayu asked.

Enzo's stomach tightened.

"Just… walk," he said.

Adit smirked. "Walk to where? Midnight?"

Enzo forced a shrug. "Need air."

Rangga watched him for a moment, then said calmly, "Back before one."

Enzo nodded.

Tia's gaze flicked to his cap.

Her eyes narrowed slightly, as if she could read the shape of a story.

But she said nothing.

Enzo left.

The hallway light flickered as he descended the stairs.

Outside, Jakarta was still awake.

Motorbikes buzzed past. Street vendors packed up slowly, as if the night was a job too. The air smelled of rain that hadn't fallen yet.

Enzo ordered a ride.

As the car moved through the city, his heart thudded.

He kept checking his phone.

Mira's green dot blinked.

Online.

Then a message.

**MiraCheng:** i'm here. i'm inside. near the back. don't look around too much.

Enzo swallowed.

He arrived at the mall.

It was quieter than he expected, but still bright, still clean, still humming with air-conditioning and soft music. Security guards stood near the entrance, scanning faces.

Enzo pulled his cap lower.

He walked inside.

The café sat on the second floor, tucked near a bookstore.

He approached slowly.

His eyes scanned the tables.

Couples. Families. A group of teenagers laughing over iced drinks. A lone man working on a laptop.

Then--

At the back corner, near a wall of fake plants, someone lifted their head.

She wore a cap and a mask.

Her hijab was tucked neatly beneath the cap, the fabric dark, modest. Her eyes were the only visible part of her face.

But Enzo recognized them immediately.

Not because they were famous.

Because he had memorized them in video calls.

Because he had listened to the way her voice softened when she said his name.

Enzo stopped.

For a second, he couldn't move.

This was not a screen.

This was a person.

A real person, breathing the same air.

Mira--Zira--stood up.

Her movements were careful, like she was used to being watched.

She didn't wave.

She didn't smile wide.

She simply looked at him.

Enzo's throat tightened.

He stepped closer.

They stood an arm's length apart.

In that small gap, Enzo felt everything--distance, time, messages at two in the morning, the weight of expectations.

Mira's eyes softened.

"You're taller than your camera," she said quietly.

Enzo blinked.

A laugh almost escaped him.

"I… didn't know my camera lied," he murmured.

Her eyes crinkled slightly above the mask.

It was the closest thing to a smile he could see.

She gestured to the seat opposite her.

Enzo sat.

For a moment, they just stared.

It was awkward.

It was tender.

It was terrifying.

"I can't stay long," Mira said softly.

Enzo nodded. "I know."

Her gaze dropped briefly to his cap.

"You look like… a criminal," she said, voice amused.

Enzo huffed a laugh, relief loosening his chest. "You told me to wear it."

"I did," Mira admitted. "But still."

Enzo stared at her.

He wanted to say a hundred things.

How unreal this felt.

How he'd been scared she would disappear.

How he'd worried he would disappoint her when she saw his real face.

Instead, he said the safest truth.

"Thank you for coming," he whispered.

Mira's eyes held his.

"I had to," she said.

Enzo frowned slightly. "Had to?"

Mira's gaze flicked away, toward the café entrance.

"Because if I didn't," she said quietly, "this would stay in my phone forever. And my life… is already full of things that are not mine."

Enzo's chest tightened.

He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice. "Are you safe?"

Mira's eyes returned to him.

For a second, something raw flickered there.

"I'm safe," she said, the word chosen carefully. "I'm… watched."

Enzo swallowed.

Watched.

He understood that.

In Manila, being watched meant neighbors gossiping, friends judging, your mother's worry.

For her, watched sounded like an entire machine.

A waiter approached.

Mira didn't remove her mask.

She ordered in a soft Indonesian, careful, concise.

Enzo ordered water.

When the waiter left, Mira's eyes lingered on Enzo's hands.

"They're shaking," she said.

Enzo looked down.

His fingers were indeed trembling slightly.

He clenched them under the table. "I'm fine."

Mira's gaze softened.

"You're not fine," she said gently. "You're human."

Enzo let out a breath.

He wanted to believe her.

He wanted to believe being human was allowed.

Mira reached into her bag and pulled out something small.

A keychain.

It was shaped like a tiny green dot.

Enzo blinked.

Mira slid it across the table.

"I bought it on the way," she said, voice almost shy. "It's stupid. But…"

Enzo picked it up.

The plastic was smooth, cheap, harmless.

But his throat tightened anyway.

"The online dot," he whispered.

Mira's eyes crinkled slightly again. "Yes."

Enzo's fingers closed around it.

It felt like holding a secret.

Or a promise.

"You shouldn't spend money on me," Enzo said quickly.

Mira's gaze sharpened. "It's not money. It's… small. Don't make it big."

Enzo swallowed.

He was so used to money being a problem.

He forgot that for her, money could be a weapon.

Mira leaned back slightly, eyes scanning his face.

"You look tired," she said.

"Scrims," Enzo replied.

"How are they?"

Enzo hesitated.

He could admit the truth.

He could be honest.

"They're good," he said. "But… it's hard. Language. Timing."

Mira nodded slowly. "You'll adapt."

Enzo stared. "How do you know?"

Mira's gaze held his.

"Because you adapted to me," she said softly. "Even when you were scared."

Enzo's chest tightened.

He looked away.

Across the café, two teenagers glanced in their direction.

Enzo's stomach dipped.

Mira noticed.

Her posture straightened slightly, her movements becoming controlled.

"Don't look at them," she murmured.

Enzo lowered his gaze. "Are they--"

"They might be nothing," Mira said. "Or they might be everything."

Enzo's fingers tightened around the keychain.

The waiter returned with Mira's drink.

Mira took it carefully, mask still on, then slipped the straw under the edge, taking small sips without exposing her face.

Enzo watched.

The act looked practiced.

Like she had lived inside privacy compromises for years.

"I want to tell you something," Mira said suddenly.

Enzo's heart kicked. "What?"

Mira's eyes dropped to her drink.

"My mother knows something is happening," she whispered. "Not you. Not… us. But she knows I'm… distracted."

Enzo swallowed. "What did she say?"

Mira's eyes lifted.

"She said if I ever want to help a team," Mira said slowly, "my family can sponsor."

Enzo blinked.

Sponsor.

He imagined Kuda Hitam's torn couch, their mismatched desks, their holey mousepad.

Money could transform them.

Money could save them.

It could also ruin them.

Mira continued, voice low. "But it comes with conditions."

Enzo's stomach tightened. "What conditions?"

Mira's eyes held his.

"She said the story must be controlled," Mira whispered. "No 'scandal.' No 'random Filipino boy.' If there's sponsorship, it must be… respectable."

Enzo's throat tightened.

Random Filipino boy.

He knew she was quoting her mother.

But it still landed like a slap.

Mira's gaze softened quickly, like she'd seen the wound she'd opened.

"I didn't agree," she added. "I didn't say yes. I just… want you to know."

Enzo swallowed.

He forced his voice steady. "So… they sponsor Kuda Hitam if… you stay clean?"

Mira nodded once.

"And if… you don't."

The rest of the sentence didn't need to be said.

If she didn't stay clean, the money could become pressure.

Or punishment.

Enzo's fingers clenched under the table.

He hated the idea of her family using money like a leash.

He hated the idea of his own life being cheap enough to be a rumor.

But he hated even more the idea of being the reason she suffered.

"Mira," he began, then stopped.

He didn't know what he was allowed to say.

Mira's eyes watched him.

"I'm not asking you to fix it," she whispered. "I'm not asking you to… become someone else."

Enzo's throat tightened.

The words echoed her earlier warning: *don't let them turn you into something you're not.*

He nodded slowly.

"Okay," he whispered.

Mira's eyes crinkled with something like relief.

For a moment, the café noise faded.

The soft music.

The clink of cups.

The distant hum of the mall.

All Enzo could hear was his own heartbeat and Mira's quiet breathing.

He wanted to reach across the table.

He didn't.

Instead, he lifted the keychain slightly. "This… I'll keep it."

Mira's eyes softened.

"Good," she said.

Another pause.

Then Mira whispered, "Can I--"

She stopped.

Enzo leaned forward slightly. "Can you what?"

Mira's gaze dropped, almost shy.

"Can I see your face without… cap shadow?" she asked.

Enzo blinked.

The request was small.

But it felt enormous.

He hesitated.

Then, slowly, he lifted the cap brim just enough.

Mira's eyes focused.

Like she was memorizing him.

Enzo's throat tightened.

This was what intimacy was, he realized.

Not kisses.

Not dramatic confessions.

Just someone wanting to see you clearly.

Mira's eyes softened further.

"Okay," she whispered, almost to herself.

Enzo swallowed.

"What?" he asked.

Mira's gaze held his.

"You're… not a dream," she said quietly.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He didn't trust his voice.

He nodded.

Across the café, the teenagers stood up.

One of them glanced toward Mira.

Enzo's stomach dipped.

Mira's posture shifted instantly.

She glanced at her phone.

"Time," she whispered.

Enzo's heart kicked. "Already?"

Mira nodded. "Driver waiting. If I'm late--"

Enzo's throat tightened. "Okay."

Mira stood.

For a moment, she hovered, as if deciding something.

Then she reached out.

Her fingers touched his forearm--brief, light, electric.

Enzo's breath caught.

Mira's voice dropped, barely audible. "Good luck with bootcamp."

Enzo swallowed. "Thank you."

Mira's fingers slid away.

She adjusted her cap, mask, hijab.

A practiced shield.

Then she walked toward the exit.

Enzo watched her go, heart thudding.

He should have left too.

He should have waited.

He should have been careful.

But he stayed seated for a second too long, staring at the space she'd occupied.

Because part of him wanted to believe this moment could remain private.

That the world wouldn't notice.

That the internet wouldn't sniff out the scent of something real.

He stood, finally, and moved toward the exit, keeping distance.

As he stepped into the mall corridor, he saw the teenagers again.

They weren't looking at him.

They were looking at Mira.

One of them lifted a phone.

Not obviously.

Not dramatically.

Just a small tilt, a quick camera angle.

A flash of screen glow.

Enzo's stomach dropped.

Mira didn't notice.

Or she did and chose not to react, continuing with smooth, controlled steps like a professional.

Enzo froze.

His fingers curled around the keychain in his pocket.

The tiny green dot pressed into his palm.

Online.

Always.

But suddenly, in the bright mall light, Enzo understood the other meaning of being online.

Visible.

Traceable.

A signal anyone could follow.

He watched Mira disappear into the flow of people.

Then he turned away, heart hammering, a cold thread of fear winding through his excitement.

Because he could already imagine the headline.

He could already imagine Bayu's anger, Tia's frustration, Rangga's disappointment.

And worse--

he could imagine Mira's mother, smiling politely as she tightened the leash.

Enzo walked out into the Jakarta night.

The city air wrapped around him again, warm and heavy.

He ordered a ride back to bootcamp.

On his phone, Mira's green dot blinked.

Online.

Still.

Enzo stared at it as if it could protect them.

As if a small dot could hold back a world that was already lifting its camera.

***

When Enzo returned to the apartment, the scrim area lights were off.

Bayu was asleep on the couch, arm over his face.

Adit's phone glowed in his hand even as he slept.

Rangga sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee, eyes heavy.

Tia stood near the window, phone pressed to her ear, voice low.

She turned as Enzo entered.

Her gaze flicked over him.

Cap.

Plain shirt.

Late-night return.

She didn't ask.

But her eyes narrowed slightly--like a woman who had survived enough chaos to recognize the shape of incoming storms.

Enzo's throat tightened.

He nodded, a silent apology.

Tia's expression remained unreadable.

She turned back to her call.

Enzo moved to his mattress corner and sat down.

He pulled the keychain out.

The green dot caught the dim light.

He held it between his fingers.

A promise.

A risk.

A small, stubborn thing.

His phone buzzed.

A message from Mira.

**MiraCheng:** made it home. thank you for being real

Enzo's chest tightened.

He typed back slowly.

**Enzo:** thank you for coming

Then he hesitated.

He almost added: *someone took photo.*

But he didn't.

He didn't want to scare her.

He didn't want to make the fear real.

So he wrote something smaller.

**Enzo:** sleep

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** okay. you too

The green dot blinked.

Online.

Enzo stared at it until his eyes burned.

Because he could still see the teenager's phone.

The small tilt.

The glow.

The moment privacy became content.

And in the quiet of Kuda Hitam's cramped bootcamp, Enzo realized, with a sinking certainty, that the first meeting had been off-camera only for them.

For everyone else--

it had already begun to go viral.
