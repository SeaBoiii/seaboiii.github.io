Title: Crowned, Then Held

order: 10
---

The finals day began before the sun fully decided what it wanted to be.

Jakarta's morning arrived gray and humid, the sky heavy with a threat of rain that never quite fell. The bootcamp apartment smelled of instant coffee, sweat, and something like burnt hope. Everyone moved slower than usual--not because they were lazy, but because their bodies had reached the kind of exhaustion where speed became dangerous.

Enzo sat on his thin mattress and stared at his hands.

They looked normal.

Five fingers.

Calluses.

Small scars.

But he knew what they had done in the last forty-eight hours.

Ugly wins.

A comeback from near death.

A stolen lord.

A base defense that felt like holding back the ocean with two palms.

Lower bracket had forced them to become something they weren't.

Not flashy.

Not clean.

Stubborn.

They had beaten Shivana.

They had beaten Saigon Mirage.

Then, with the crowd's disbelief thick as smoke, they had beaten a third opponent in the lower gauntlet--**Manila Wraith**--a Filipino team seeded higher than them, whose fans had arrived in loud waves expecting to claim Enzo's victory as national pride.

Instead, Enzo had beaten them.

Not out of spite.

Out of necessity.

That match had been the ugliest of all.

Filipino slang hurled across stage lights.

Old friends turned to strangers.

Enzo had kept his face neutral and played the map.

When they won, he hadn't celebrated.

He'd just stared at his shaking hands and realized: he couldn't go home yet.

Because the story was bigger now.

Because the internet had started to shift its tone from laughter to curiosity.

Because Kuda Hitam had become addictive.

The team with nothing kept refusing to die.

And in the final lower bracket match, they had faced **Jade Dynasty** again.

The Chinese powerhouse.

The team that had crushed them in groups.

This time, it wasn't a miracle.

It was work.

Rangga drafted discipline.

Bayu learned patience.

Adit stopped chasing.

Enzo became a wall.

They won in a bruising thirty-minute war that left the crowd standing and shouting like they'd witnessed a ghost.

Jade Dynasty's players had walked off stage without looking at anyone.

Not angry.

Stunned.

Kuda Hitam had reached the grand finals.

A dark horse run that the bracket had not permitted.

And waiting at the end of it--

like a crown waiting on a hook--

was Bosphorus Titans.

The defending champions.

Still undefeated.

Still on their golden road.

The rematch.

The story the tournament wanted.

The story the internet could not resist.

Enzo's phone buzzed on the mattress beside him.

He didn't need to look to know.

But he did.

Mira.

**MiraCheng:** finals today.

He stared at the message until the words felt unreal.

Finals.

Today.

He typed:

**Enzo:** yeah

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'm coming

Enzo froze.

His stomach dropped.

He typed fast.

**Enzo:** no

Then he deleted it.

He remembered her earlier: don't command her. don't treat her like a child.

He retyped.

**Enzo:** it's risky

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** everything is risky

Enzo's throat tightened.

He glanced toward the small kitchen.

Rangga sat at the table, staring at his notes.

Bayu was pacing quietly, jaw clenched.

Adit was stretching his fingers, breathing too fast.

Tia stood by the window, phone pressed to her ear, speaking in quiet Indonesian.

Enzo caught one phrase.

"…deadline hari ini…"

Deadline today.

Cheng Group.

The leash.

Enzo's fingers tightened around his phone.

He typed:

**Enzo:** if you come, don't be seen. please.

A pause.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'll be careful

Enzo swallowed.

He didn't know if careful was possible anymore.

He locked his phone and stood.

Rangga looked up.

"You ready?" Rangga asked.

Enzo exhaled. "No."

Rangga's mouth twitched, almost a smile. "Good. Ready people get careless."

Bayu snorted. "I'm ready to kill."

Tia's voice cut in, flat. "Kill the draft. Not the players."

Adit laughed weakly.

Enzo's chest tightened.

His team was still here.

Still alive.

Still bleeding.

He looked down at his hands.

"Okay," he whispered.

***

The venue on finals day was a different beast.

The crowd was bigger.

The lights brighter.

The air sharper.

Everything smelled of sweat and adrenaline and sponsor money.

The hallways were packed with camera crews.

Fans in jerseys.

Influencers filming content.

Security guards stationed like chess pieces.

On the main stage, the trophy sat under a spotlight.

Gold.

Heavy.

Waiting.

Enzo stared at it as they walked past.

For a second, he felt like a thief in a rich man's house.

Then Bayu bumped his shoulder lightly.

Not hostile.

Grounding.

"Don't stare," Bayu muttered. "It will stare back."

Enzo huffed a faint laugh.

Rangga's voice was calm. "We play, not dream."

Tia walked behind them with a folder tucked under her arm.

Not just tournament documents.

Cheng Group's proposal.

Deadline today.

Enzo felt the paper's weight even from a distance.

They entered the warm-up room.

Bosphorus Titans were already there.

Clean jerseys.

Calm faces.

Their coach spoke quietly.

Their captain, Kaiser, sat with his hands folded, eyes on a tablet.

He looked like he had slept.

Enzo hated him for that.

Not personally.

Existentially.

Because the difference between Titans and Kuda Hitam wasn't just skill.

It was comfort.

Titans' comfort came from structure and money and history.

Kuda Hitam's comfort came from pain.

From being used to scarcity.

Enzo sat down at his station.

He adjusted his mouse.

He tested his headset.

He didn't look at Titans.

He didn't want their calm to infect his doubt.

His phone buzzed.

Mira.

He didn't check.

Not now.

Tia's voice cut through.

"Finals are best-of-seven," she said. "Long. They will try to outlast you. We cannot panic when we lose games. We cannot tilt. We cannot chase the story."

Bayu's jaw clenched. "We just play."

Rangga nodded. "We just play."

Adit swallowed hard. "Okay."

Fikri murmured, "Okay."

Enzo breathed.

"Okay," he whispered.

***

The opening ceremony was loud enough to swallow fear.

Fire effects.

Music.

Crowd chants.

The casters' voices booming.

"…GRAND FINALS! Bosphorus Titans, undefeated, defending champions--versus Kuda Hitam Esports, the lower bracket dark horses! Can the miracle complete?"

The crowd roared.

Enzo sat under stage lights and felt his face become a mask.

The series began.

Game 1.

Titans drafted clean.

Kuda Hitam drafted comfort.

They fought.

They bled.

They lost.

Not a stomp.

But decisive.

Titans' midgame rotations suffocated.

Enzo felt the familiar erasure.

Game 2.

Rangga adjusted.

A pocket pick.

A bait ban.

For a moment, it worked.

They took early towers.

They secured turtle.

The crowd roared.

Then Titans adapted.

A trap at lord.

A wipe.

They lost again.

0-2.

The arena's energy shifted.

The crowd still cheered, but the tone became expectant.

This is where the underdogs fall.

This is where the golden road continues.

Enzo took off his headset between games and stared at his hands.

His fingers trembled.

Bayu slammed his fist lightly against his thigh. "We're doing it again."

Adit's voice cracked. "It's like RO16."

Rangga's face stayed calm, but his eyes were tight.

Tia leaned in behind them, voice low. "Breathe. We reset. We are not the same team as RO16."

Enzo's throat tightened.

He remembered Mira's message.

Write yourself back.

He wanted to.

But Titans were writing too.

Game 3.

Kuda Hitam drafted weird.

A flex.

A lane swap.

They tried to break Titans' script.

Titans didn't panic.

They absorbed.

They traded.

They punished one small mistake.

Adit died once.

Then twice.

Bayu overforced.

Titans secured lord.

They ended.

0-3.

Match point.

The crowd roared again.

Not for Kuda Hitam.

For the inevitability of history.

Enzo sat still.

His heartbeat thudded in his throat.

He could feel the story tightening around them.

The internet would love this.

The underdogs run out of fuel.

The champions complete the golden road.

The influencer's team loses.

The Filipino import collapses.

Neat.

Easy.

Consumable.

Enzo's hands were cold.

He glanced down at his phone.

One new message.

He opened it before he could stop himself.

**MiraCheng:** i'm here

Enzo's breath caught.

He looked up.

Stage lights blinded, but the audience was visible in layers--rows of faces, banners, phones.

He scanned.

He didn't know what he was looking for.

Then he saw it.

Not at the front.

Not near the camera.

A few rows back, near the aisle.

A cap.

A mask.

A hijab tucked beneath.

And a handmade poster held tight in both hands.

The poster was simple.

Thick marker.

One word.

**ONLINE.**

Enzo's throat tightened.

His chest felt like it was caving and opening at the same time.

She was anxious.

He could see it even from here.

Her shoulders stiff.

Her fingers white around the poster.

But her eyes--

her eyes did not look away.

She wasn't hiding.

Not fully.

Not anymore.

Enzo's breath came in harsh bursts.

Rangga's voice came through comms. "Enzo?"

Enzo swallowed.

He forced his gaze back to the screen.

The draft timer ticked.

Match point.

One more loss.

And it was over.

He whispered, barely audible.

"Okay."

Not a surrender.

A vow.

He looked at his team.

Bayu's jaw clenched, eyes bright with anger and fear.

Adit's hands trembled.

Fikri stared at the screen like it was a prayer.

Rangga's face was calm, but his shoulders were tight.

Tia stood behind them, eyes sharp, holding her breath.

Enzo spoke.

His voice was steady.

"Reset," he said quietly. "We play slow. We don't chase. We take what they give. We make them impatient."

Bayu blinked. "They don't get impatient."

Enzo's eyes stayed on the draft.

"They will," he said. "If we stop being scared."

Rangga's breath hit the mic.

Then he said, calm.

"Okay. We trust."

They drafted for discipline.

Not for glory.

A composition that could scale.

That could defend.

That could punish overcommit.

Titans drafted to end.

Fast tempo.

Early pressure.

They wanted the trophy now.

The game loaded.

From minute one, Enzo played like his body had been rebuilt.

He held lane.

He didn't trade stupidly.

He watched the minimap like it was scripture.

When Titans invaded, he didn't chase.

He traded.

When Titans forced turtle, he didn't panic.

He conceded and took tower.

Small wins.

Measured.

The crowd's noise shifted.

Less roaring.

More tension.

Because Kuda Hitam wasn't dying quickly.

Titans grew restless.

You could see it in small things.

Their roamer lingered too long.

Their mid took a greedy wave.

Their jungler tried to secure too aggressively.

At ten minutes, Titans started lord.

Early.

A statement.

Enzo's palms were damp.

He whispered into comms.

"Wait."

Rangga's voice snapped. "We wait."

They hovered.

Titans committed.

And Enzo saw it--the half-second greed.

He moved through fog.

He flanked.

He struck the backline.

Stun.

Burst.

Adit followed.

Bayu secured.

The lord reset.

Titans' carry died.

The crowd roared--real this time.

Not for the champions.

For shock.

For the crack in the golden road.

Kuda Hitam didn't overchase.

They took what they could.

They took map.

They took space.

They breathed.

They won Game 4.

The scoreboard shifted.

**1-3.**

The crowd roared again, louder.

Because underdogs returning from match point was addictive.

Game 5.

Titans adjusted.

They drafted safer.

They tried to choke slowly.

But Kuda Hitam had learned to live in suffocation.

They didn't panic.

They defended.

They punished one mistake.

They stole a lord.

They won.

**2-3.**

The arena turned.

The noise became belief.

Enzo's hands shook between games.

Not fear.

Adrenaline.

He glanced up again.

Mira was still there.

Poster still held.

ONLINE.

Her eyes were glossy.

But steady.

Enzo's throat tightened.

Game 6.

Titans began to tilt--not loudly, not obviously.

A missed timing.

A poor rotation.

A forced fight.

Kuda Hitam punished.

They took towers.

They took map.

They won.

**3-3.**

Silver scrapes.

The crowd screamed.

Even Titans looked unsettled now.

Kaiser's calm face tightened at the jaw.

Their coach leaned in more urgently.

The golden road was bleeding.

Game 7.

Final.

Everything.

Enzo's vision tunneled.

He could barely hear the casters.

He could barely hear the crowd.

All he heard was comms.

Rangga's voice, steady.

Bayu's breathing, loud.

Adit's whispered prayers.

Fikri's calm calls.

Tia's silence behind them.

And somewhere beyond the lights--

Mira.

ONLINE.

The draft was tense.

Titans tried to ban Kuda Hitam's comfort.

Kuda Hitam answered with discipline.

They locked a composition built for patience.

Titans locked one built for tempo.

The game loaded.

The early game was even.

Every trade mattered.

Every camp.

Every wave.

At eight minutes, Titans forced a fight.

Kuda Hitam disengaged cleanly.

The crowd gasped.

At ten minutes, Kuda Hitam took turtle.

At twelve, Titans took tower.

At fifteen, both teams hovered around lord.

Enzo's palms were slick.

He wiped them quickly.

Rangga's voice was low.

"Wait for mistake," Rangga said.

Bayu's voice was tight. "They won't."

Enzo stared at the minimap.

He saw the smallest thing.

Titans' midlaner stepped into fog for half a second too long.

Confidence.

Fatigue.

Greed.

Enzo's heartbeat kicked.

"Now," Enzo whispered.

Rangga didn't hesitate.

Engage.

The pick was clean.

The crowd roared.

They started lord.

Titans rushed to contest.

The teamfight exploded.

Health bars dropped.

Bayu nearly died.

Adit repositioned perfectly.

Fikri zoned.

Enzo flanked.

He waited.

Waited.

Then he struck.

Stun.

Burst.

Titans' carry fell.

Lord secured.

The arena screamed.

Enzo's breath came in sharp bursts.

Push.

Lane.

Tower.

Titans defended desperately.

Kaiser's calls were sharp.

They wiped one of Kuda Hitam's waves.

They cleared lord.

They tried to counterpush.

Rangga's voice snapped. "Reset. Don't chase."

Enzo's voice was calm.

"Patience," he said.

Patience.

A word that had never belonged to him before this tournament.

Second lord.

Both teams hovered again.

Titans forced.

Kuda Hitam waited.

Then, in the chaos of the pit, Bayu stole it.

Adit screamed.

The crowd exploded.

Titans panicked.

Just for a second.

And in that second, Kuda Hitam broke them.

They pushed.

They cracked base.

Titans defended, but their formation was broken.

Enzo saw the angle.

He dove.

He hit the backline.

Rangga followed.

Adit's damage landed.

The enemy core dropped.

Victory.

The screen flashed.

**CHAMPIONS.**

For a moment, Enzo didn't move.

He couldn't.

His body felt like it had been emptied.

Then the crowd noise hit him like a wave.

A roar so loud it blurred into vibration.

Bayu screamed.

Adit sobbed.

Rangga leaned back, eyes squeezed shut.

Fikri covered his face with one hand.

Tia--

Tia's knees bent slightly as if the tension had finally left her bones.

Enzo ripped off his headset.

Confetti cannons fired.

Gold paper rained.

The arena became a storm of light.

Enzo stood.

He looked toward the crowd.

Mira was already moving.

She rose from her seat, poster crumpled in her hands, pushing carefully through the aisle.

Cap.

Mask.

But she wasn't hiding now.

Not fully.

Security tried to stop her.

She lifted her badge--VIP access, money's passport.

They let her through.

She reached the barrier.

Her eyes met Enzo's.

They were wet.

Shaking.

But fierce.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He stepped off the stage edge.

Someone shoved a microphone toward him.

A camera flashed.

The world wanted a quote.

Enzo ignored it.

He walked toward Mira.

For a second, he hesitated.

Because the world was watching.

Because contracts existed.

Because morality clauses were waiting.

Because her mother's smile was somewhere in the shadows.

Then Mira reached him.

She didn't speak.

She didn't pose.

She simply stumbled forward like the last hour of fear had finally been allowed to turn into movement.

Enzo caught her.

His arms wrapped around her instinctively, tightly.

Her body trembled against his chest.

He could feel her breath through her mask.

The poster crumpled between them.

ONLINE.

Now bent and wrinkled.

A proof.

Enzo lowered his forehead to hers.

The mask barrier between them made the touch softer.

Still real.

He whispered so only she could hear.

"You stayed."

Mira's breath shook.

"I stayed," she whispered back.

Enzo's throat burned.

He wanted to say love.

He didn't.

Because love, in this world, was a headline.

Instead, he whispered another truth.

"Thank you."

Mira's hands clenched in his shirt.

Then, in a voice so small it almost disappeared under the crowd roar, she said,

"They can't erase you now."

Enzo's chest tightened.

Can't.

Now.

Because champions were harder to buy.

Harder to silence.

Harder to rewrite.

Cameras flashed.

Casters screamed.

The internet would clip this.

It would meme it.

It would speculate.

But in Enzo's arms, Mira trembled like a real person, not a brand.

Enzo held her anyway.

Let the world watch.

Let them guess.

Because for once, the story wasn't theirs to control.

It had been earned.

***

Later, in the dim corridor behind the stage, the noise became muffled again.

The trophy sat on a rolling cart, still gleaming.

Tia leaned against the wall, eyes wet, laughing and crying at the same time like she didn't know which emotion deserved to win.

Bayu kept muttering, "We did it. We did it," as if repeating it made it real.

Adit held the medal in his hand and stared at it like it might vanish.

Rangga sat on the floor, head back against the wall, eyes closed.

Enzo stood near a staff door with Mira beside him.

She had removed her cap now, but not her mask.

Her hijab was slightly crooked.

A real mess.

Enzo wanted to fix it.

He didn't.

Because touching her now felt like lighting a match in a room full of gasoline.

Tia approached, still wiping her face.

She glanced at Mira.

Then at Enzo.

Her voice was low. "Cheng Group is outside."

Enzo's stomach dropped.

Even now.

Even on the day of victory.

The leash didn't sleep.

Mira's shoulders stiffened.

Enzo's jaw clenched.

Tia continued, eyes sharp. "They're smiling. They're saying congratulations. They're saying they're proud. They want to finalize the sponsorship."

Enzo swallowed.

Mira's eyes lifted to him.

Fear.

Hope.

Defiance.

Enzo inhaled.

He looked down at his hands.

They were still shaking.

But now they were shaking around a medal.

A proof.

He looked at Tia.

"We don't sign tonight," Enzo said quietly.

Tia's eyes sharpened.

"Good," she whispered.

Enzo looked at Mira.

He spoke softly, so only she could hear.

"I'll be smart brave," he said.

Mira's eyes shimmered.

She nodded.

"Okay," she whispered.

Enzo's throat tightened.

Okay.

Their word.

Now it felt like a promise with teeth.

Outside the corridor, the world waited--cameras, contracts, smiles.

But Enzo held Mira's gaze.

He had won against champions.

Now he had to win against something harder.

A story.

A family.

A cage made of money.

Tia exhaled and lifted her chin.

"Come," she said. "Let's go meet them."

Enzo's fingers curled.

He glanced once more at the trophy.

Gold.

Heavy.

Real.

Then he took one breath.

In.

Out.

And stepped forward, not toward the stage this time--

but toward the people who believed they could own the ending.
