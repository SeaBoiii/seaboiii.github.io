Title: Round of 16 - Dismantled
novel: lower-bracket-lovers
order: 7
---

The draw show was supposed to be entertainment.

That was how the casters sold it--bright smiles, energetic voices, suspenseful music that swelled beneath the stage lights. The camera cut between glossy team portraits and crowd reactions, as if the bracket was a game of chance rather than a slow, mathematical arrangement of who would be allowed to dream.

But in the cramped quiet of Kuda Hitam's warm-up room, the draw felt like a verdict being read.

They were huddled around a single laptop balanced on Adit's knees. Bayu sat cross-legged on the floor, arms folded like he was bracing for impact. Rangga leaned forward with his elbows on his thighs, eyes fixed and unblinking. Fikri stood behind them, expression unreadable, hands clasped loosely as if he was trying not to show tension.

Tia didn't sit.

She paced.

Her phone sat in her hand like a pulse. Every few steps she glanced down at the screen, then back up at the laptop, then away again--as if she was watching two storms approach from different directions.

Enzo sat with his back against the wall, knees drawn up, the green-dot keychain looped around one finger.

He tried to breathe.

He tried not to think about what knockouts meant.

Group stage had been barely breathing.

Knockouts would be suffocation.

The draw began.

Team names appeared on screen in bright, animated tiles. The production made it look playful.

Enzo hated that.

Adit's leg bounced under the laptop, making the screen shake.

"Bro, stop," Bayu muttered.

Adit's eyes stayed glued to the stream. "I can't."

On screen, the host reached into a transparent box and pulled out the first ball.

Cheers.

A matchup.

Another.

The bracket began to form like a spine.

Enzo's mouth went dry.

He watched the tiles, the logos, the subtle shifts in probability.

Shinobi Arc drew a middle-seeded SEA team.

Jade Dynasty drew a Japanese wildcard.

Selat Strikers--eliminated--were already making meme edits on Twitter, Enzo knew, because that was what teams did when they were out: they tried to stay relevant.

Then the host reached for another ball.

A bright flash.

A logo appeared.

**Kuda Hitam Esports (ID).**

Adit made a small, strangled sound.

Bayu's jaw clenched.

Rangga's gaze sharpened.

The host smiled, voice rising theatrically. "And who will the dark horses face in the Round of 16?"

He reached into the second box.

The crowd at the venue roared, anticipating.

Enzo's heartbeat thudded in his fingertips.

The host pulled.

The logo spun on screen.

Gold.

Black.

A titan silhouette.

**Bosphorus Titans (TR).**

For a fraction of a second, the room in West Jakarta went completely silent.

Then Bayu laughed.

It was the same laugh as the morning of the leak--short, disbelieving, edged with poison.

"Nice," Bayu said softly. "Golden road. Defending champs. Unbeaten. We're dead."

Adit's face went pale. "Bro…"

Rangga exhaled slowly through his nose, then said, in a voice that was too calm to be comfort, "Okay."

Enzo's fingers tightened around the keychain.

Bosphorus Titans.

He'd watched their VODs.

Not for fun.

For fear.

They didn't just win.

They dissected.

They drafted like they were writing a script.

They punished mistakes like they were allergic to mercy.

And they were undefeated in this tournament.

Golden road.

The phrase sounded like destiny.

Tia stopped pacing.

She stared at the laptop screen like she was trying to find a crack in the bracket.

She didn't.

Her shoulders lifted slightly on an inhale.

Then she said, quietly, "We prepare."

Bayu scoffed. "Prepare what? Funeral?"

Tia's eyes snapped to him.

The look was sharp enough to cut.

Bayu fell silent.

Adit swallowed. "We can go lower bracket if we lose, right?"

Rangga nodded once. "Double elimination. We lose, we drop."

Adit's voice trembled. "So we're not dead."

Bayu's laugh came out bitter again. "Lower bracket is death with extra steps."

Enzo stared at the floor.

He could already feel the internet's storyline forming.

KHE versus reigning champions.

The underdogs get stomped.

Influencer distraction.

Filipino import exposed.

A neat arc.

Easy to consume.

Tia clapped once.

"Enough," she said.

The room snapped back into manager mode.

Rangga straightened.

Bayu's expression tightened.

Adit's bouncing leg slowed.

Tia's voice stayed even. "We have forty-eight hours. We will not beat them by being scared. We beat them by being specific."

Bayu muttered, "Specific dead."

Tia ignored him.

Rangga nodded. "We need draft plan. We need early game plan. Titans love tempo. We need to disrupt."

Fikri finally spoke, soft but clear. "They bait objectives. They trade like… machines."

Enzo swallowed.

Machines.

He thought of Shinobi Arc.

He thought of Jade Dynasty.

Bosphorus Titans were different.

They were both.

Enzo's phone buzzed in his pocket.

He didn't pull it out.

He could already guess who it was.

The green dot still burned against his skin like a secret.

Tia's phone buzzed too.

She glanced down.

Her expression tightened.

She looked at Enzo for half a second.

Then she looked away.

And Enzo understood without a word.

The other storm was arriving.

***

They spent the afternoon in a room that wasn't theirs.

A small conference space provided by the venue--neutral carpet, white walls, a long table that smelled faintly of disinfectant. The kind of room where corporate people signed agreements and smiled politely as they tightened invisible ropes.

Kuda Hitam's laptops were set up along one side. On the other side, a projector played Bosphorus Titans' last three games.

They watched.

And watched.

And watched.

At first, it was normal analysis.

Draft.

Lane assignments.

Objective timings.

Then it became something darker.

Because the more Enzo watched, the more he realized Titans didn't win fights.

They won time.

They made every second count.

If you rotated late, you lost a camp.

If you showed on a wave, you lost vision.

If you hesitated, you lost the map.

By the time you understood what they were doing, they had already moved on to the next thing.

Bayu paused the VOD at a crucial lord fight.

"See?" Bayu said, voice tense. "They bait. They let enemy start lord, then they collapse from three angles. Perfect timing."

Rangga nodded. "We don't start lord without vision. We don't get baited."

Adit frowned. "But how we win then?"

Silence.

Tia stood at the front of the room, arms folded, eyes fixed on the screen.

Enzo stared at the minimap in the VOD.

The ward placements.

The rotations.

The way Titans' roamer disappeared at the exact moment a trap was ready.

He felt cold.

In ranked, you could win by being better.

Here, you had to win by being smarter.

Or at least unpredictable.

Enzo exhaled slowly.

"We can't out-discipline them," he said quietly.

Everyone looked at him.

Bayu's eyes narrowed. "So we lose?"

Enzo shook his head. "We can… break their script. Make them react."

Rangga leaned forward. "How?"

Enzo's mind raced.

He thought of chaos.

Not stupid chaos.

Controlled chaos.

A draft that forced Titans out of comfort.

Early invade timings that disrupted jungle.

Lane swaps.

Pocket picks.

He spoke slowly, careful. "They prepare for standard. We give them non-standard. Something that looks wrong. Something that makes them waste time confirming."

Adit's eyes widened. "Cheese?"

Enzo nodded slightly. "But smart cheese. Not throw."

Bayu scoffed. "We're not clown team."

Rangga's voice stayed calm. "We are underdogs. We can afford to be weird."

Tia's gaze sharpened at Enzo. "You have something in mind?"

Enzo swallowed.

He did.

A hero pick he'd kept hidden.

A flex that could shift lanes unexpectedly.

A draft that looked like a mistake until it wasn't.

He nodded. "Yes."

Tia studied him for a moment.

Then she said, "Show."

They spent the next hour building a plan.

Not a guarantee.

A puncher's chance.

Enzo felt his hands stop trembling.

Because when you had a plan, fear became a task.

Then, just as the room began to feel almost hopeful, Tia's phone buzzed again.

She stepped away to answer.

Enzo watched her walk to the corner.

He watched her posture stiffen.

He watched her face become polite.

He couldn't hear every word.

But he caught phrases.

"Ya… terima kasih… yes, we understand… keluarga Cheng…"

His stomach dropped.

Bayu noticed too.

His eyes narrowed.

Rangga's jaw tightened.

When Tia ended the call, she didn't return immediately.

She stared at her phone for a long moment.

Then she looked up.

"Break," she said.

Bayu scoffed. "Break? For what?"

Tia's voice stayed even, but her eyes were tight. "Because we need to breathe before we talk about money."

The room fell silent.

Enzo's chest tightened.

Here it was.

The leash.

Tia walked back to the table, placed her phone down, and looked at them like a woman about to deliver bad news disguised as an opportunity.

"We received a sponsorship offer," Tia said. "Title sponsor. Big. Covers bootcamp upgrades, travel, staff, security, media team. Maybe even salary increases."

Adit's eyes widened. "We need that."

Bayu's jaw clenched. "Who?"

Tia hesitated.

Her gaze flicked to Enzo.

Then she said, quietly, "Cheng Group."

The words landed like a weight.

Enzo felt cold.

Cheng.

Mira's family.

Bayu's eyes flashed. "What the hell is Cheng Group?"

Rangga's voice was calmer, but tight. "Influencer family."

Adit's mouth fell open. "Mira's family?"

Silence.

Fikri's expression didn't change, but his fingers tightened around his pen.

Bayu's gaze snapped to Enzo.

Enzo didn't look away.

He couldn't.

Bayu's voice came low and sharp. "So this is the price. We lose sponsor because of you, then you bring sponsor because of her."

Enzo's throat tightened.

"It's not--" he started.

Tia cut in sharply. "Enough. We are not doing blame math."

Bayu scoffed, but he shut up.

Tia continued, voice clipped. "The offer comes with conditions."

Rangga's eyes narrowed. "Of course."

Tia nodded once. "Media clause. NDA. No personal statements. No content that implies romance. No meetings. No public interactions. Any 'brand association' must be approved. And…"

Her voice paused.

Enzo's stomach tightened.

"And what?" Adit asked, voice small.

Tia exhaled slowly. "And they want a 'narrative shift.'"

Bayu let out a bitter laugh. "Narrative shift?"

Tia's eyes were hard. "They want to frame the relationship--if it exists--as professional. Influencer supports a local team as part of youth esports development. Filipino import is talent scouted through program. Everything clean. Everything proper."

Proper.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He heard Mira's mother saying it.

He imagined Mira sitting upstairs, breath caught in her throat.

Rangga rubbed his forehead. "And if we refuse?"

Tia's mouth tightened. "They'll still sponsor someone else. Or they'll sponsor nothing. But they will still protect their daughter. Their offer isn't charity. It's control."

Bayu's jaw clenched. "We don't take it."

Adit's eyes widened. "Bro, we need money."

Bayu snapped, "Money that makes us puppets?"

Adit's voice rose, desperate. "We're already puppets of poverty!"

Silence.

The room held that sentence like a bruise.

Tia's gaze softened for half a second.

Then hardened again.

"We decide after Round of 16," she said. "Not now. Not before Titans. We don't let this become another distraction."

Bayu scoffed. "Too late."

Tia's eyes snapped. "Bayu. If you keep poisoning the room, I will bench you. I don't care if you're our best jungler. I don't care if you're angry. We survive with discipline."

Bayu stared at her.

Then, slowly, he looked away.

Rangga exhaled. "After Round of 16."

Tia nodded.

Her gaze returned to Enzo.

This time, it wasn't assessing.

It was… warning.

"Enzo," she said quietly, "this will come back. Be ready."

Enzo swallowed.

"Okay," he whispered.

But okay didn't feel like safety anymore.

It felt like a cliff.

***

That night, Enzo lay on his thin mattress in the bootcamp apartment, staring at the ceiling.

The fan buzzed.

Outside, Jakarta traffic murmured like an endless river.

Bayu's snoring drifted from the couch.

Adit whispered to someone on his phone, voice low and frantic, as if trying to keep himself from falling apart.

Rangga sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee, still awake, still thinking.

Tia was in the small room she shared with her laptop and her exhaustion. Enzo could hear the faint click of keys.

Enzo's phone lay on his chest.

Mira's chat was open.

He stared at it for a long time before typing.

**Enzo:** tia said your family offered sponsor

His thumb hovered.

He hesitated, then added:

**Enzo:** with conditions

Three dots appeared.

They stayed.

Then disappeared.

Then appeared again.

Finally:

**MiraCheng:** i know

Enzo's chest tightened.

Of course she knew.

Her family didn't do anything without informing her, even if it was disguised as protection.

He typed:

**Enzo:** are you okay?

A pause.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'm tired

Two words.

They felt heavier than any paragraph.

Enzo swallowed.

He wanted to call.

He didn't.

Because calls were risky.

Because the machine could listen.

Instead, he typed something small.

**Enzo:** we drew bosphorus

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** i saw

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i'll pray again

Enzo closed his eyes.

He didn't know how prayer worked.

But he knew what it meant when someone did it for you.

He typed:

**Enzo:** thank you

Then, because honesty was all he had left:

**Enzo:** if your family uses money to control you… or me… i don't want it

Three dots appeared.

Then Mira replied:

**MiraCheng:** i don't want it either

Enzo's throat tightened.

For a moment, the world felt simpler.

Two people agreeing.

No.

But simplicity never lasted.

Mira sent another message.

**MiraCheng:** but enzo… your team needs it. and my mom knows.

Enzo stared.

Needs it.

Knows.

A trap.

He typed slowly.

**Enzo:** we'll decide after match

Three dots.

**MiraCheng:** okay

Enzo stared at the word.

Okay.

Their word.

Now it felt like a vow made under pressure.

He locked his phone.

He stared at the ceiling.

He tried to sleep.

He couldn't.

Because tomorrow, they would face the champions.

And outside the game, someone was already drafting a contract.

***

Round of 16 day arrived with a kind of cruel clarity.

The venue buzzed early, as if the building itself was excited to watch someone bleed.

Knockout banners hung along the corridors. Camera crews moved like sharks. Staff handed out schedules and smiled as if they weren't sending teenagers and young adults into a pressure cooker.

Kuda Hitam arrived in matching jerseys that still smelled faintly of cheap detergent.

The fabric sat slightly loose on Enzo's shoulders.

He wondered if Bosphorus Titans' jerseys smelled like expensive cologne.

They walked through the tunnel toward staging.

Enzo kept his face neutral.

Inside, he was vibrating.

As they passed a lounge area, Enzo saw Bosphorus Titans for the first time up close.

They weren't taller.

They weren't physically intimidating.

They were… clean.

Their hair was neat. Their posture relaxed. Their eyes calm.

They looked like people who expected to win because the world usually agreed with them.

Their captain--Kaiser--glanced toward Kuda Hitam.

His gaze landed briefly on Enzo.

Not hostile.

Not mocking.

Just measuring.

Then he looked away.

As if Enzo was already solved.

Bayu muttered, "I hate that face."

Rangga's voice came low. "Ignore."

Tia walked behind them, expression sharp.

She didn't speak.

But Enzo could feel her tension.

Not just for the match.

For everything that would come after.

They entered the staging area.

The roar of the crowd hit them.

This was a featured match.

Underdogs versus champions.

Everyone loved a narrative.

The casters' voices boomed.

"…and here they are! Bosphorus Titans, the defending champions, still undefeated, still on a golden road--can anyone stop them?"

The crowd roared.

Then:

"…and on the other side, Kuda Hitam Esports! The team that scraped through groups, the team with nothing to lose--will we see a miracle?"

The crowd cheered again, louder this time.

Miracles were addictive.

They made good clips.

Enzo sat at his station.

He adjusted his mouse.

He placed his hands on the keyboard.

He breathed.

Rangga's voice came through comms, steady. "We play our plan. We don't chase. We don't ego. We make them react."

Bayu grunted. "Okay."

Adit's voice was tight. "Okay."

Fikri murmured, "Okay."

Enzo whispered, "Okay."

The draft began.

They executed their 'smart cheese'.

They took the flex pick.

They left a trap in the second phase.

They banned a comfort hero Titans had abused in every series.

For a moment--just a moment--Enzo felt a flicker of hope.

Because Bosphorus Titans paused.

Not long.

But enough.

Their coach leaned in.

Kaiser's lips moved.

They discussed.

They reacted.

Enzo's pulse kicked.

They're thinking.

We made them think.

Then the Titans locked their response.

A draft that wasn't panicked.

A draft that was… elegant.

They didn't counter with brute force.

They countered with inevitability.

Enzo swallowed.

The game loaded.

Minute one--

Bosphorus Titans invaded.

Not a wild invade.

A measured one.

They placed vision deep, stole a camp, then left before Bayu could even commit to a fight.

Bayu's voice rose. "They're in my jungle."

Rangga's voice stayed calm. "Trade. We take their opposite camp."

Enzo moved.

He rotated early, hugging fog.

He arrived at the enemy buff.

It was empty.

They had already cleared.

They had already moved.

Enzo's stomach dipped.

Titans weren't just reacting.

They were predicting.

At three minutes, Titans' roamer appeared top.

Not for a dive.

For pressure.

He stood in the brush, visible for half a second, then vanished.

Enzo felt his skin prickle.

A threat without action.

A psychological ward.

He backed off the wave, losing gold.

Titans' EXP laner pushed.

Mid lane pressure increased.

Adit's voice tightened. "Mid missing."

Rangga's voice snapped. "Care."

Too late.

Titans' mid rotated bot.

Adit burned flicker.

He survived--but he lost lane control.

At five minutes, Titans started turtle.

Rangga called contest.

Bayu moved.

Enzo rotated.

Fikri arrived.

Adit came late.

They tried.

They engaged.

For one second, it looked winnable.

Then Titans' counter-engage hit like a door slammed.

A stun chain.

A burst.

Bayu's health vanished.

Rangga fell.

Enzo backed off instinctively, but Titans chased not for kills--

for map.

They took turtle.

They took mid tower.

They took vision.

Enzo's chest tightened.

They were doing it.

The suffocation.

But cleaner.

Faster.

Bayu's voice went sharp. "We fight!"

Rangga's voice was tight now. "We can't. We reset."

Bayu's breathing was loud.

Enzo forced himself to speak calm. "We trade side. We take top tower."

They tried.

But Titans had already rotated.

Top tower defended.

Enzo's hero was zoned off wave.

He lost gold.

He lost experience.

He felt the game slipping like sand.

At ten minutes, Titans started lord.

Not because they needed it.

Because they could.

Kuda Hitam hovered near the pit.

Rangga's voice whispered through comms. "We cannot let them free."

Enzo stared at the minimap.

He saw their opening.

A tiny one.

Titans' jungler stepped slightly forward.

Enzo's heart kicked.

"Now," Enzo said.

Rangga engaged.

Bayu dove.

Adit followed.

For a heartbeat, the fight exploded.

Enzo's stun landed.

The crowd roared.

It looked like a miracle.

Then Kaiser's voice--unheard, but felt--answered.

Titans' backline repositioned perfectly.

Their support peeled.

Their damage stayed untouched.

Bayu died.

Adit died.

Rangga fell.

Enzo retreated with a sliver of health.

Fikri escaped, barely.

Lord secured.

The arena's roar shifted.

Not surprise.

A satisfied exhale.

Because the champions had reasserted gravity.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He felt cold.

He felt exposed.

He felt the internet already clipping the fight and labeling it:

**KHE TRY CHEESE -- STILL LOSE.**

At thirteen minutes, Titans pushed.

They took base tower.

They took inhibitor.

They didn't overstay.

They reset.

They waited for the second lord.

They ended at sixteen minutes.

Clean.

Not a massacre.

A demonstration.

As the defeat screen flashed, Enzo kept his face neutral.

But his throat burned.

His hands were shaking.

He wanted to slam something.

He wanted to scream.

He wanted to disappear.

Beside him, Bayu ripped off his headset and muttered something in Indonesian that sounded like a prayer and a curse.

Adit's eyes were wide and wet.

Rangga stared forward, jaw clenched, expression controlled to the point of pain.

Fikri exhaled slowly, long, like he was letting go of a held breath.

The casters' voices boomed.

"…and Bosphorus Titans remain undefeated! The golden road continues!"

The crowd roared.

Then, with a familiar sting:

"…Kuda Hitam drops to the lower bracket. The question now is--can the underdogs survive the gauntlet?"

Lower bracket.

The word sounded like a pit.

Enzo stood for the handshake line.

Kaiser's hand was cool and dry.

He met Enzo's eyes briefly.

Then, in accented English, he said quietly, "Good try."

It wasn't mockery.

It was worse.

It was kindness from someone who expected your loss.

Enzo nodded.

"Thanks," he murmured.

Then he walked off stage.

The lights dimmed behind them.

The roar muffled.

Backstage, the corridor felt cold.

Not from air-conditioning.

From reality.

Tia waited.

Her face was calm.

Her eyes were not.

Bayu slammed his palm against the wall lightly.

Adit whispered, "We got destroyed."

Rangga exhaled. "We're in lower bracket. We still breathe."

Bayu laughed bitterly. "Barely."

Tia stepped forward.

She didn't scold.

She didn't comfort.

She said, "Phones away. Now."

Enzo's stomach dipped.

Because he knew why.

Because after a loss, the internet fed.

Because after a loss, the story sharpened its knives.

They returned to the warm-up room.

And the phones buzzed anyway.

Through bags.

Through pockets.

Through the thin fabric of denial.

Adit's phone vibrated like a trapped insect.

Bayu's buzzed twice, then stopped.

Rangga's lit up, then went dark.

Enzo's buzzed once.

Then again.

He resisted.

He lasted one minute.

Then he looked.

Mira.

**MiraCheng:** i'm sorry

Enzo's throat tightened.

He stared at the word.

Sorry.

The one word she told him not to use.

He typed quickly.

**Enzo:** don't

Then he deleted it.

He retyped.

**Enzo:** it's okay. we're lower bracket now

A pause.

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i watched. they were… scary

Enzo swallowed.

He typed something honest.

**Enzo:** they didn't beat us. they erased us

Three dots.

Then Mira replied:

**MiraCheng:** then write yourself back

Enzo stared.

Write yourself back.

It sounded like a poem.

It sounded like a command.

It sounded like Mira trying to give him something she couldn't give herself.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He typed:

**Enzo:** are you okay?

Three dots appeared.

They stayed.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** my mom is meeting your manager tonight

Enzo's stomach dropped.

Meeting.

Tonight.

He looked up sharply.

Tia was in the corner of the warm-up room, phone pressed to her ear, expression polite.

Enzo couldn't hear her words.

But he could see the posture.

Corporate posture.

Polite posture.

The posture you used when someone offered you a gift wrapped around a leash.

Bayu noticed too.

His eyes narrowed.

Adit swallowed.

Rangga's jaw clenched.

Enzo felt cold.

He looked back at Mira's message.

**my mom is meeting your manager tonight**

The sentence felt like a trapdoor opening.

Enzo typed with trembling fingers.

**Enzo:** did you choose that?

Three dots.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** i tried to stop it

Enzo's throat burned.

He imagined Mira downstairs, her mother's voice like silk and steel.

He imagined her father's quiet gaze.

He imagined the printed photo on the coffee table.

He typed:

**Enzo:** i don't want them to control you

A pause.

Then:

**MiraCheng:** then win

Enzo froze.

Two words.

Not romantic.

Not comforting.

Desperate.

Because if Kuda Hitam kept winning, they would have leverage.

Because if Kuda Hitam lost, they would have nothing.

And people with money loved negotiating with people who had nothing.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He stared at the green dot keychain.

He hadn't taken it out in days.

But he could feel it in his pocket.

A tiny circle.

A reminder.

He thought of Mira holding a mask over her face in a café.

He thought of his mother at the airport, saying smart brave.

He thought of Tia's tired eyes.

He thought of Bayu's anger.

He thought of Rangga's calm.

Then he looked at his team.

Bayu was staring at the wall, jaw clenched.

Adit's hands were shaking.

Rangga was already opening the bracket schedule.

Fikri was quiet, but his eyes were sharp.

Tia ended her call.

She turned.

Her face was composed.

But her shoulders looked heavier.

"We play tomorrow," she said.

Lower bracket.

First elimination match.

No room.

No mercy.

Tia's gaze moved across them.

Then it landed on Enzo.

"After we practice," she said, voice low, "we talk about the sponsor."

Bayu's laugh came out bitter. "We're selling our souls already?"

Tia's eyes flashed. "We're deciding whether we have a soul to sell."

The room fell silent.

Enzo's phone buzzed again.

A new message from Mira.

**MiraCheng:** stay online

Enzo's throat tightened.

He typed back one word.

**Enzo:** okay

He didn't know if he was promising Mira.

Or promising the team.

Or promising himself.

All he knew was that the golden road had crushed them.

And now, the lower bracket waited like a long corridor with no exits.

Outside the game, a contract was being drafted.

Inside it, Enzo's hands still worked.

He stared at the schedule.

He whispered, so softly no one heard:

"One more."

And the green dot in his pocket pressed into his skin like a pulse, like a warning, like a vow.
