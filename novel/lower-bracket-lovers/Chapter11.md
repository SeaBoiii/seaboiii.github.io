The confetti didn't end when the cameras stopped.

It clung.

Gold paper tucked itself into the seams of jerseys, into the edges of shoes, into the folds of lanyards and hair and hijab pins. It followed them into hallways and staff rooms like a stubborn memory, like glitter that refused to let you forget the party even when you needed to breathe.

The corridor behind the stage was quieter than the arena, but not silent. You could still hear the world through the walls--the roar fading into a low ocean, the occasional spike of cheering when the screens replayed the final teamfight, the distant thud of bass as production staff packed up music cues and sponsor videos.

It smelled different back here.

Not popcorn.

Not sweat.

Mostly cold air-conditioning and hot electronics.

A hint of perfume from the VIP lounge that had already tried to turn their lives into a contract.

Enzo stood with his back against a white wall that had faint scuff marks near the base, as if countless other players had leaned here before him, in other years, with other trophies, with other lives they would still have to live once the lights went out.

His medal sat heavy around his neck.

The strap rubbed against the side of his throat when he swallowed.

He kept touching it, not for pride.

For proof.

The trophy was somewhere down the corridor on a rolling cart, guarded by staff as if gold could grow legs and run.

Kuda Hitam's laughter came and went in bursts.

Bayu's voice kept repeating, "We did it," like he was trying to hypnotize himself into believing.

Adit's laughter sounded like a sob sometimes.

Rangga had disappeared into a quieter corner, sitting on the floor with his head tilted back against the wall, eyes closed as if sleep was the only victory he wanted.

Tia moved between them all like a woman who couldn't afford to collapse yet. Her cheeks were still damp, but her jaw was set. She spoke to staff, nodded to sponsors, accepted congratulations with a polite smile that didn't quite touch her eyes.

Because the world didn't stop.

Even when you won.

Especially when you won.

Beside Enzo, Zira stood with her cap tucked under her arm now, mask still on, hijab slightly crooked. The poster--**ONLINE**--was folded and creased, the thick marker letters distorted by the bend. She held it against her stomach like a secret, both hands wrapped around it as if it were fragile.

Enzo watched her fingers.

They were trembling.

Not dramatically.

A quiet shake you might miss if you weren't looking.

He didn't touch her.

Not yet.

Not because he didn't want to.

Because the corridor still belonged to cameras.

To staff.

To people passing through with badges and phone screens.

And he could feel, even now, the invisible leash of optics.

A door opened farther down the hall and a burst of laughter spilled out--someone from a sponsor booth congratulating someone else, the sound bright and quick.

Zira flinched slightly, shoulders stiffening.

Enzo glanced at her face.

Only her eyes were visible.

They were glossy.

Tired.

Alive.

"You okay?" he asked softly.

Zira's gaze flicked to him.

Her eyes softened, a tiny crack in the mask.

"I don't know," she whispered.

Enzo's chest tightened.

That answer was too honest for this corridor.

Too human.

Zira exhaled slowly. "I feel like… I'm still in the crowd."

Enzo nodded.

He understood.

He still felt stage lights behind his eyes even in shadow.

He lifted his cracked phone from his pocket and stared at it.

The same phone.

The same chipped case.

The same small spiderweb of cracks in the corner of the screen where he'd dropped it once rushing to accept a queue.

It looked wrong next to a championship medal.

Like the poor kid had stolen a rich man's prize.

But it was the only object that had been with him from the beginning.

From Manila heat.

From late-night deliveries.

From the first duo queue at two thirteen.

From the first time Zira's voice had entered his headset like a door opening.

His phone buzzed.

He thought, briefly, it might be Tia.

Or a reporter.

Or another sponsor with a smile like a trap.

But the screen displayed a name that tightened his chest.

**Mama**

Enzo stared at it for a second too long.

Then he answered.

"Ma," he said quietly.

His mother's voice came through, crackling slightly over distance.

It wasn't loud.

It was steady.

"You won," she said.

It wasn't a question.

It was disbelief wearing a thin layer of calm.

Enzo swallowed.

"Yeah," he said.

A pause.

Then his mother exhaled.

Enzo could picture her--sitting at their small table, the fluorescent bulb buzzing, her hands folded in front of her like she didn't know what to do with pride.

"Alam mo," she said softly, "I watched on my phone."

Enzo's throat tightened.

"You watched?"

"Si Tito Ramon nag-send," she replied, and Enzo could hear the faint smile in her voice. "May link. Sabi niya… 'Ate, nanalo yung anak mo.'"

Enzo blinked hard.

His eyes stung.

His mother continued, voice quieter now. "Are you safe?"

Enzo inhaled.

Safe.

The question sounded different coming from her.

From his mother, it meant: are you alive, are you fed, are you hurt.

From rich people, safe meant: are you controlled.

"I'm safe," Enzo said.

His mother paused.

Then, as if she couldn't help it, she added, "Kumain ka na?"

Enzo let out a small laugh that broke into something wet.

"Not yet," he admitted.

"Eat," his mother said sharply, the old routine sliding back in. "Wag puro adrenaline."

Enzo swallowed.

"Okay," he whispered.

His mother's voice softened. "Proud ako sayo."

Enzo's breath caught.

Proud.

The word had been heavy from Mira.

From his mother, it felt like a blessing.

"Ma," Enzo began.

His voice cracked.

His mother didn't let him drown in sentiment. She cleared her throat.

"Call me later," she said quickly. "When you are not busy. And…"

A pause.

"And be smart brave," she finished.

Enzo closed his eyes.

"Okay," he whispered.

The call ended.

He stared at his phone.

The cracked corner reflected the corridor light.

Zira watched him.

Her eyes softened.

"Your mom?" she asked.

Enzo nodded.

"She watched," he said, voice rough.

Zira's gaze flickered--surprise, warmth, and something like grief.

She swallowed.

Enzo didn't ask about her mother.

He didn't need to.

Her mother was a shadow you could feel even when she wasn't in the corridor.

As if summoned by thought alone, Zira's phone buzzed.

She stiffened.

Enzo watched her fingers tremble as she pulled it from her pocket.

She glanced at the screen.

Her breath caught.

Enzo didn't see the name, but he saw the way her shoulders tightened.

Family.

The machine.

Zira hesitated.

Then she answered.

She turned slightly away from Enzo--not to hide, but to protect something private.

"Ma," she said softly.

Her voice was careful.

The influencer voice, not fully.

The daughter voice, not fully.

Somewhere between.

Enzo leaned his head back against the wall and listened without trying to. The corridor carried sound.

He heard only fragments.

"…ya…"

"…saya…"

A pause.

Then, clearer, a voice on the other end--sharp in Enzo's ears despite distance--asked a question.

Not approving.

Not warm.

But softer than before.

"Zira… kamu aman?"

Are you safe?

Zira's breath shook.

"Yes," she whispered. "Aku aman."

The voice on the phone paused.

Enzo could hear it in the silence.

Not acceptance.

Not surrender.

But something tired.

As if even steel could feel strain.

Then the voice continued, lower.

"Jangan bikin kami malu."

Don't embarrass us.

Zira's jaw tightened.

Her eyes closed briefly.

"I know," she said softly.

The call ended.

Zira stood frozen for a moment, phone still pressed to her ear as if she hadn't realized it was over.

Enzo watched her.

He wanted to take the phone from her hand and throw it down the corridor.

He wanted to tell her she didn't deserve to carry that.

But he didn't.

Because he didn't know how to fight a mother.

He knew how to fight a map.

He knew how to fight a champion.

This was different.

Zira lowered her phone.

Her eyes were wet.

But she didn't cry.

Not here.

Not in a corridor where people could pass and turn tears into content.

Enzo's throat tightened.

"You okay?" he asked again, softer.

Zira's gaze flicked to him.

Her eyes searched his face.

As if checking for judgment.

As if checking if he would leave.

She whispered, "They're not… approving."

Enzo nodded.

He didn't need more explanation.

He didn't need a villain speech.

He could feel the shape of it.

"But… she asked if I'm safe," Zira added, voice almost incredulous.

Enzo's chest tightened.

He understood.

That question--simple, human--was the closest thing to softness she'd been given.

Even if it came wrapped in conditions.

Zira exhaled.

"I don't know what happens now," she whispered.

Enzo stared at his cracked phone.

He thought of the VIP lounge.

The ten-minute smile.

The proposal folder.

The morality clause.

He thought of Tia's eyes.

Deadline today.

He thought of the trophy on the cart.

Gold.

Heavy.

Real.

He could win games.

He could win tournaments.

But could he win a life?

He didn't know.

He only knew the next small step.

Enzo lifted his phone.

His thumbs hovered over the keyboard.

Zira watched him, confused.

He typed a single word.

**online**

Then he hit send.

A message sent to Zira.

Even though she stood right beside him.

Even though he could have spoken it.

Even though it was ridiculous.

The phone pinged.

Zira's screen lit up.

She glanced down.

Her eyes widened slightly above the mask.

A shaky laugh escaped her--small, disbelieving, like she couldn't decide if it was sweet or stupid.

"Enzo," she whispered, voice breaking slightly on his name.

Enzo stared at his phone.

He didn't look up.

He needed the safety of a screen for a moment.

Zira's fingers moved.

She replied.

Enzo's phone buzzed.

He looked.

**always**

A single word.

Not a vow spoken to the world.

Not a confession for cameras.

A private promise tucked inside a chat bubble.

Enzo's throat tightened.

He let out a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding.

He finally looked at her.

Zira's eyes were wet.

But her gaze was steady.

Always.

Enzo's fingers curled around his phone.

The cracked screen dug gently into his palm.

A reminder.

Not of damage.

Of survival.

Footsteps echoed down the corridor.

Tia's voice called from farther away, brisk and sharp.

"Enzo! Zira! We move. Now."

Zira flinched.

Enzo turned his head.

Tia stood near the corner, waving them urgently, face composed but tense.

The world was starting again.

Sponsors.

Interviews.

Contracts.

Smiles.

Enzo tucked his phone into his pocket.

He felt the green-dot keychain press into his palm.

A tiny circle.

A pulse.

He glanced at Zira.

"Ready?" he asked softly.

Zira swallowed.

Then she nodded.

"No," she whispered, honest. "But… okay."

Okay.

Their word.

Enzo's mouth twitched, almost a smile.

"Okay," he echoed.

They started walking.

Not toward the stage.

Not toward the crowd.

Toward the next room where people would try to rewrite what they had earned.

And as they moved through the corridor, the last bits of confetti clung to their clothes like stubborn proof.

After the confetti, there were still calls.

Still questions.

Still cages.

But in Enzo's pocket, his cracked phone held a word that felt like a door he could keep opening.

**always**

Not a guarantee.

Not a fairy tale.

Just a signal.

Two people staying online in a world that kept trying to disconnect them.
