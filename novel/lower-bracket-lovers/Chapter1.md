The screen threw blue light across Enzo's knuckles, turning the fine hairs on his fingers into pale threads. His cheap phone case--rubber peeling at the corners--pressed a faint ridge into his palm where he gripped it too hard. The air in his room was warm in a way that didn't feel like comfort; it felt like a mistake the day had left behind. Outside, a neighbor's dog barked in short, angry bursts. Somewhere deeper in the building, someone's television murmured on, always on, as if silence was a thing people here couldn't afford.

**Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.**

The red stamps lined up like bruises in his match history.

Enzo exhaled slowly through his nose and tried to unclench his jaw. He'd promised himself he'd stop an hour ago. Promised his mother, too, in the way he always did--without saying it out loud. He imagined her asleep in the next room, the thin wall between them failing to hide the shape of her tiredness. She worked mornings at the bakery, afternoons at a cousin's eatery when the cousin needed someone, evenings folding clothes under the fluorescent bulb that flickered when the neighbors overloaded the grid.

Twenty-two was a strange age to still feel like you were borrowing your own life.

His headset was the kind with one ear muff held together by tape. The microphone bent too easily if you weren't careful. He wore it anyway, because on nights like this, a voice on the other end of a game could sound like a door opening.

He stared at the "Ranked" button.

One last game.

That was always the lie.

He tapped.

The queue timer began its slow climb. A soft ticking sound, like a polite reminder that time was happening regardless of whether you were ready.

Enzo shifted on the edge of his narrow bed. The springs complained. He pulled the small fan closer, let it blow warm air across his face, and tried to ignore the itch of defeat under his skin. Losing wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was feeling--briefly, horribly--average.

He hated that feeling.

Not because he thought he deserved more. Because he knew what he was capable of.

The match found.

A sharp chime. Draft screen.

Names flickered into place.

He scanned them automatically, habit and instinct. Local players mostly, judging by the tags. Some nonsense clan abbreviations. Someone with a name like "xxSavageBoyxx." Someone else who'd clearly typed random symbols just to look intimidating.

Then he saw it.

**MiraCheng.**

Not a dramatic name. Not edgy. It sat on the screen with a quiet confidence, like it didn't need to shout to be noticed.

He didn't know why it caught his attention. Maybe it was the clean simplicity. Maybe it was the fact that it wasn't trying.

The pick phase began.

Enzo's role settled into EXP lane by default--his comfort. His refuge. He hovered over a hero he knew like muscle memory, the kind you could play half-asleep and still outtrade people who thought the lane was won by aggression alone.

But the first thing that happened wasn't his pick.

It was a ping.

Not the frantic, spammy kind. Not the kind teammates used to blame you.

A single, deliberate ping at the river bush. A suggestion, not a command.

Enzo's eyes narrowed.

Whoever that was understood tempo.

The draft continued. Someone on his team tried to lock in a questionable assassin with no frontline support. Enzo sighed internally. Typical. Ranked was a lottery of ego.

Another ping came, this one toward the mid lane.

Then a chat message, short and calm:

> **MiraCheng:** roam early. I'll cover.

Enzo blinked.

A mid laner offering to cover. In ranked.

That alone was enough to make him sit up straighter.

He locked his hero in.

The loading screen washed across his phone. Portraits. Emblems. Skins. Effects.

Then the battlefield.

The familiar map appeared like a stage he'd performed on a thousand times, and yet every match still felt like stepping into a different kind of weather.

Enzo moved to lane with measured steps. He didn't rush the first wave. He watched the enemy's positioning, the small hesitations that betrayed inexperience. He traded once--clean, minimal--then backed off.

Mid lane pings again.

A single ping, then two.

Enzo glanced at the minimap.

Their roamer was late. Their jungler was wandering aimlessly. The enemy team smelled blood.

And MiraCheng--mid--did something Enzo rarely saw.

She didn't panic.

She let the enemy overextend. She waited until their mid stepped one pixel too far, then flicked a skill with the kind of precision that looked effortless.

Stun.

Burst.

First blood.

The announcer's voice rang out, and Enzo felt something shift inside him--not excitement, exactly. Recognition.

His fingers moved faster.

He pushed his wave, rotated toward the turtle, and--without needing a word--mirrored her tempo.

They met at the river like two people arriving at the same place from different roads.

The enemy jungler approached, confident, thinking this was a free objective.

MiraCheng pinged once.

Enzo understood.

He stepped into the bush, held his skill, waited for the moment.

The jungler leapt.

Enzo struck.

Mira followed.

The turtle reset, the enemy jungler fell, and the objective turned into theirs.

**Teamwork.**

In ranked.

Enzo's lips twitched, almost a smile.

His headset crackled with the faint ambient noise of his own room, but the game's sound filled most of his head. Skill effects. Footsteps. The faint, constant hum of the battlefield.

On the scoreboard, they were suddenly ahead.

Not because their other teammates improved.

Because MiraCheng and Enzo were quietly dragging the entire match forward.

The enemy team adapted. They began ganking his lane more. They tried to shut him down, to break the rhythm.

But every time they moved, MiraCheng was already a step ahead.

She rotated before danger arrived. She pinged warnings early, not when it was too late. She never wasted pings blaming people; every ping was information.

Enzo found himself anticipating her decisions.

When she disappeared from mid, he knew she was cutting through jungle to contest vision.

When she held her ultimate, he knew she was saving it for a decisive fight.

When she typed "wait," he waited.

It was the first time in weeks the game didn't feel like drowning.

It felt like flying.

At twelve minutes, the match pivoted.

A teamfight near the lord pit. Their roamer finally tried to do something useful and immediately got caught. Their gold laner panicked and burned flicker too early.

Enzo's screen flashed red--half his team was dying.

The enemy team rushed the lord.

This was the part where ranked games usually ended: five strangers collapsing in different directions.

MiraCheng pinged twice.

Then, unexpectedly, a voice icon appeared.

A request.

**Voice chat invite.**

Enzo's thumb hovered.

He didn't usually talk. Not because he couldn't. Because words were too intimate, and intimacy with strangers on the internet was a risk.

But this wasn't a stranger, not entirely. Not after the way she'd moved on the map.

He accepted.

For half a second, there was only static.

Then a voice--female, clear, slightly hushed like she was also trying not to wake someone.

"EXP," she said, and her tone wasn't demanding. It was focused. "Can you hold your stun? Don't show. Let them commit."

Enzo's breath caught.

Her accent wasn't Filipino. Not the singsong cadence he'd grown up around.

Indonesian.

Soft edges. Certain vowels rounded in a way that felt… familiar, even if he couldn't place why.

"Okay," Enzo replied before he could think.

His own voice sounded rough, underused.

"Good," she said, and there was something in that single word--approval without flirtation, trust without drama.

Enzo slid into the bush near the pit.

The enemy team's health bars dipped as they hit lord.

Their confidence was visible in their positioning. Loose. Arrogant.

Mira's voice came again, quieter. "Now. Three… two… one."

Enzo stepped out.

His stun landed on the jungler.

Mira's ultimate hit mid and gold simultaneously.

Their panicking teammates--miraculously--followed.

The lord reset.

The enemy jungler died.

And suddenly, for the first time all match, the battlefield belonged to them.

"Nice," Mira said.

Enzo didn't answer. He was too busy chasing the last fleeing enemy into the river, too busy feeling his own blood rush with something like… joy.

They took the lord.

They marched.

They ended.

Victory splashed across the screen in gold and blue.

Enzo stared at it for a second too long.

He didn't move.

The voice chat stayed open.

There was a small sound on the other end--fabric shifting, maybe. A quiet exhale.

"You're not just good," Mira said, as if continuing a thought she'd been holding since the first turtle fight. "You're… clean. Like you don't waste anything."

Enzo swallowed.

Praise in game was one thing.

Praise from a voice that sounded real--tired and careful--was something else.

"Thanks," he said, awkward. "You're… you read the map."

A soft laugh. Not loud. Not performative. Like she was smiling to herself.

"I have to," she replied. "People are… unpredictable."

Enzo leaned back against the wall. The paint felt warm against his shoulder.

He hesitated.

"What time is it there?" he asked.

"Two thirteen," she said.

Enzo blinked at his phone clock.

Two thirteen.

Same.

He didn't know why that detail made his chest tighten.

"Why are you awake?" he asked.

A pause.

"Because if I sleep early," she said carefully, "my day becomes… other people's."

Enzo didn't fully understand what she meant.

But he understood the weight of it.

He glanced toward the thin wall that separated him from his mother.

"My day is other people's too," he admitted, surprising himself.

Another pause, softer this time.

Then Mira asked, "Do you want to queue again?"

Enzo should have said no.

He should have ended the call, put down the phone, slept.

But the green dot beside her name glowed like an invitation.

Like proof that somewhere, across sea and distance, someone was still awake--still choosing this moment.

"Yeah," Enzo said, voice quieter now. "One more."

Mira's laugh returned, faint and warm.

"One more," she agreed.

And Enzo tapped "Ranked" again, knowing very well it was a lie--

--but also, for the first time in a while, hoping it wasn't.

***

By the third game, they weren't just winning.

They were syncing.

By the fifth, Enzo had learned her habits: the way she liked to ward the right-side bush first, the way she saved her ultimate for the second wave of a fight, the way she never, ever typed in all caps.

By the seventh, Mira had learned his: the way he held his skills like he was saving money, the way he rotated without needing permission, the way he never chased kills if it cost them objectives.

Between games, their call stayed open.

Sometimes they talked.

Mostly they didn't.

And somehow, that felt more intimate than forcing conversation.

At around four, Mira murmured, "You're Filipino, right?"

Enzo startled slightly. "Yeah."

"I can tell," she said. "Your English… the rhythm."

Enzo huffed a small laugh. "And you're Indonesian."

"Mhm."

"Where?"

Another pause.

"Jakarta," she said. Then, like she had to correct the simplicity of that answer: "But I'm… complicated."

Enzo wanted to ask what that meant.

Instead, he asked something safer. "What's your main?"

Mira laughed again. "Depends who I'm playing with."

He frowned, amused. "That's cheating."

"It's strategy," she replied, mock offended.

Enzo shook his head, smiling despite himself.

A notification popped up on Mira's side--he heard it through her mic, a quick buzz.

She went quiet.

Enzo didn't push.

After a moment, she said softly, "Sorry. Family group chat."

Enzo's smile faded slightly. "They're awake too?"

"Always," Mira said. The word sounded like a cage.

Enzo imagined her in a room larger than his, with air-conditioning and clean sheets and maybe a vanity mirror with expensive lights. He imagined that none of it mattered if the pressure was constant.

"Are you okay?" he asked before he could stop himself.

Mira didn't answer immediately.

When she did, her voice was quieter than before. "I'm okay when I'm here."

Enzo's throat tightened.

Here.

In a game.

In a call.

In a space between their countries where no one else could reach.

He didn't say anything. He couldn't, not without making it too big, too real.

So he said, "We can stop if you want."

Mira's breath hit the mic, a soft sound like she'd smiled.

"No," she said. "Don't leave yet."

Enzo's fingers flexed around his phone.

"I won't," he promised.

He didn't know then how dangerous promises could be.

How a single green dot could become a habit.

How a habit could become a life.

Or how, one day, a family with too much money and too much control would look at that green dot and decide it had to disappear.

But for now--

for now, Mira's icon glowed.

And Enzo pressed "Ready."
