## Chapter 14 -- The Name That Moved

Once Hana started pinning reality, she couldn't stop.

Not because she wanted to become paranoid.

Because she had seen the first edit.

A museum exhibit that felt like it had materialized to match Ren's strategy.

A location tag that had shifted as if the world itself had nudged her evidence closer to the shrine, closer to the mark, closer to the seam.

History did not shout when it changed.

It adjusted the margins.

So Hana began living like a person who collected margins.

She made lists.

Not in the notebook.

Never in the notebook.

In her private notes, boxed and dated, like she was building her own archive.

She wrote down what time a certain café opened.

What the museum's temporary exhibit titles were.

Which pamphlets were available at the front desk.

She took photos and screenshots.

Then she exported them to a cloud folder and to a USB drive like she didn't trust either.

It felt excessive.

It also felt sane.

Because if the world could rewrite itself, then sanity was simply being the only person who remembered the previous draft.

The next week passed with the slow tension of someone waiting for an accident.

Hana kept going to work meetings, her voice calm.

She kept saying no.

She kept pretending the notebook was not a second heartbeat hidden in her closet.

At night, sometimes the notebook hummed.

Sometimes it did not.

When it hummed, Hana retrieved it, opened it, and read whatever pages Ren had left.

Never once did she pick up her pen.

Not even when her hands trembled with the need.

Ren's rule held.

Read. Do not write.

Ren's pages became stranger.

Not in language.

In shape.

Some nights he wrote like before--clean, formal lines, careful translations between fear and discipline.

Other nights the entries were shorter, broken by pauses, as if he had been forced to stop mid-sentence.

Moonlight only.

No fire.

The estate's air changing.

Attendants moving.

A rumor about foreign handwriting.

And beneath it all, the word he had used once that made Hana's chest tighten:

*Move.*

On Tuesday night, the notebook hummed at 12:08.

Hana retrieved it, opened it, and found a new page.

Ren's frame formed as always.

But the header looked different.

The date line was no longer Tenbun 20.

Hana's throat tightened.

She leaned closer.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's hands went cold.

A different name.

Ren sleeping.

Pages changing.

Not death.

A road.

Hana swallowed.

Ren had warned her: if his pages stopped, it might mean elsewhere.

Now he was telling her it was happening.

And her body reacted anyway, as if this were loss.

Because names mattered.

A name was how she held him.

A name was a handle.

If he changed it, she would have to learn to hold him differently.

Hana turned the page.

The next entry arrived in a new frame.

Still sharp-lined, still disciplined, but the era label had shifted.

The location was no longer Kaga estate.

And the name line--

Hana's throat tightened.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's chest tightened.

Does the sign remain?

No reply is needed.

You only need to look.

Hana swallowed.

She had not been back to the shrine since the clean-up.

Not closely.

Not near the lantern.

She had only seen it through a museum photo.

Ren's question landed like a hook.

If she looked, she might be safe.

If she looked, she might also become loud.

Fear has a voice.

A voice calls people.

Hana closed the notebook slowly.

Her heart was pounding.

Ren had moved.

Ren had changed.

And now he was asking her to confirm the only physical anchor they had.

Not with words.

With her eyes.

That night, Hana did not sleep.

She sat on her futon and stared at the wall.

She told herself she would not go.

She told herself the museum photo was enough.

But the museum photo was old now.

A week old.

An entire lifetime, for a man being hunted.

At dawn, Kanazawa's light seeped into her room.

Hana stood.

She washed her face.

She dressed.

She did not bring the notebook.

She did not bring chalk.

She did not bring gloves.

She brought only her phone and her wallet, like last time.

She walked to the shrine with her hands in her pockets.

The air was cold enough to sting.

The shrine grounds were quiet.

No volunteers.

No schoolchildren.

Only a priest sweeping leaves.

Hana moved carefully, keeping her posture loose, her face blank.

Just a visitor.

She walked down the lantern path.

Her heart hammered.

She approached the lantern.

She did not crouch.

She did not touch.

She simply stood beside it, as if admiring moss.

Her eyes slid to the shadowed belly.

There.

Three short lines.

Crossing.

Not a character.

The mark remained.

Hana's throat tightened.

She felt tears push behind her eyes.

She swallowed them down.

Do not make it loud.

Hana turned away immediately and walked back up the steps.

She did not linger.

She did not look back.

She left the shrine and walked until she reached the canal bridge.

Only then did she stop.

Her hands shook.

Ren had moved.

But the mark remained.

The bridge remained.

Not because it was safe.

Because it was stubborn.

Hana returned to her apartment and opened her private notes.

She created a new boxed entry.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hana stared at her note.

Her chest ached.

Because the truth was now clear.

Ren was becoming someone else to survive.

And Hana would have to learn how to love a moving target.

A man without a name.

A voice that could vanish into wind.

A bridge that remained only if she stayed quiet enough not to call eyes.

That night, the notebook hummed.

Hana opened it.

There was one more page.

No name.

No estate.

Only brush-script, heavier than usual.
