## Chapter 8 -- Three Nights, Briefly (Night Two)

The day stretched thin.

Hana went through it like someone walking across ice--careful with her weight, careful with her pace, careful not to make a sound that would crack the surface.

She did not go back to the shrine.

But her mind kept going.

It returned to the lantern again and again, to the small scratch near the mark, to the idea of volunteers with brushes and cloths and casual hands.

She imagined someone wiping moss away with the same thoughtlessness Hana used to wipe her phone screen.

She imagined the mark becoming visible for one careless second.

She imagined a person leaning closer.

Curious.

Curiosity was not evil.

In Ren's world, curiosity could still kill.

Hana tried to work.

She wrote the director summary. She prepared bullet points. She answered questions in short, professional sentences.

Her supervisor sent:

**Supervisor (11:06):** Thanks. Can you join the meeting earlier too?

Hana stared.

Her chest tightened.

She could feel the old reflex rising--*Yes, of course.*

She could feel the new seam she'd loosened yesterday.

She typed slowly:

**Hana:** I can join earlier, but I'll need to end on time. I have another commitment.

The commitment was not a lie.

It was midnight.

She hit send.

Her supervisor replied with a single: **Ok.**

Hana exhaled.

Another small victory.

Another battle.

And yet the victories did not make her feel strong.

They made her feel… strange.

Like she was learning a language she should have learned years ago.

By late afternoon, Kanazawa's rain returned, steady and patient.

Hana looked out the window and thought of Ren's weather line.

Wind, no rain.

Firelight low.

The idea that his night and her night could share the same dampness felt almost unbearable.

She made herself eat.

She took a hot shower.

She folded her clothes.

She did everything she could to keep her hands busy.

Because when her hands were idle, her thoughts became knives.

At 9 p.m., she opened her phone and searched for the shrine's volunteer clean-up again.

The notice was still there.

This weekend.

A time.

A meeting point.

Hana's throat tightened.

It was close.

Too close.

Her mind started offering solutions.

Go there first. Remove the mark. Chip it away yourself. Conceal it with moss. Scratch the whole lantern so the sign disappears into noise. Leave an offering. Ask the priest.

Each solution made her stomach twist.

Because every solution required touching the anchor.

Touching it again meant leaving new traces.

Involving priests meant involving eyes.

Trying to "protect" the sign might be the very thing that drew attention.

Ren had been right.

Fear has a voice.

A voice calls people.

Hana set her phone down.

She sat on her futon and pressed her palms together.

Not as prayer.

As discipline.

*Be restrained.*

If the bridge demanded sacrifice, then the sacrifice was control.

Hana could not control the shrine.

She could not control volunteers.

She could only control herself.

Night came slowly.

The apartment dimmed.

Hana made tea. She turned off her overhead lights.

At 11:50, she retrieved the notebook from the closet.

She carried it to the table like a fragile animal.

She sat.

Her heart beat in her throat.

This was Night Two.

Briefly.

Then Night Three.

Then silence.

Hana's chest tightened at the thought.

Silence was care.

But silence was also hunger.

At 11:59, she opened the notebook.

At midnight, she did not wait for the brush-script.

She wrote first.

She forced herself to keep it small.

Her pen hovered.

She wanted to write: *I am thinking of you too much.*

She wanted to write: *I'm scared of silence.*

But those were loud.

Those were fear.

So she stopped.

At 00:06, Ren's frame formed.

The brush-script came in quick, disciplined lines.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's stomach dropped.

Someone reached for where the notebook was.

He held his breath.

It hadn't been found.

But it was close.

Hana pressed her fingertips to the edge of the table.

The apartment felt suddenly too small.

Ren was in danger.

Not because of a sword.

Because of an unseen hand reaching for a beam.

Because of eyes.

Because of quiet suspicion.

And then--Ren's advice about cleaning.

*If something is dangerous, keep it dirty so it will not be handled.*

Hana stared.

It was a retainer's logic.

Let the valuable thing look worthless.

Let the hidden thing look inconvenient.

Let dirt be protection.

She wanted to answer.

But it was Night Two.

Brief.

And Ren had said: *Do not touch it.*

Her mind tried to argue.

What if the volunteers cleaned the lantern and erased the mark?

What if she needed to conceal it somehow?

Ren's words cut through her.

Do not touch it.

Touching meant voice.

Voice meant people.

People meant death.

Hana swallowed.

She forced her pen to move.

The entry looked almost cruel in its brevity.

Hana hated herself for it.

But this was the cost of survival.

Ren had held his breath.

Now Hana had to hold her words.

She closed the notebook.

Her hands were shaking.

She lay down and stared at the ceiling.

Outside, Kanazawa's rain returned, tapping lightly against the window.

Hana listened.

And in the tapping, she imagined Ren's breath held in the dark.

She imagined him standing still, muscles tense, while someone's hand searched near the beam.

Her chest ached.

She wanted to reach across the bridge and pull him into her world.

But bridges did not work that way.

So Hana did the only thing she could.

She kept her fear quiet.

She kept her voice small.

And she waited for Night Three.
