## Chapter 5 -- The Weight of Proof

The mark stayed under Hana's skin.

Not literally--no bruise, no cut. Just the memory of stone catching her fingertip, the subtle grit of a groove that had been carved by a hand that should not have been able to reach her world.

She woke the next morning with her fingers curled as if still holding that sensation.

For a few seconds, half-asleep, she almost believed she had dreamed everything.

Then she remembered the notebook lying on her table.

And the way Ren had written:

*If you find it, then our bridge has a map.*

Hana sat up.

Her apartment looked the same--small, neutral walls, a kettle, folded clothes. But she no longer moved inside it like it was merely a place to sleep.

Now it was a chamber.

A room that contained a door.

She didn't open the notebook immediately.

Instead, she made tea, hands moving through routine while her mind worked through questions it couldn't stop asking.

If Ren had carved the mark in his time and she had found it in hers…

Then the lantern had existed in both.

Which meant the shrine had existed.

Which meant there was a seam in the world where centuries could touch.

And if they could touch at one point, then--

Hana's throat tightened.

Could they touch at others?

Could a word in the notebook push the seam wider?

She thought of Ren calling words swords.

Even if you don't intend to cut.

She set her tea down and stared at the steam.

The steam rose and vanished.

Proof did not.

Her phone buzzed.

Hana looked.

**Supervisor (08:12):** Great. Can you also cover the summary for the director meeting? You're the best.

Hana's thumb hovered.

You're the best.

The phrase was meant as praise.

It felt like a chain.

She typed a reply out of habit.

Then deleted it.

Then typed again.

Then stopped.

She put the phone face-down.

She opened the notebook.

No new ink.

Of course not.

It was morning.

The bridge did not breathe.

But her entries and Ren's sat there, unchanged, as if waiting.

Hana reread her own words from last night.

*Please tell me you got back safely.*

The sentence made her stomach drop.

She had asked him for reassurance.

A normal thing to ask.

A human thing.

But what if reassurance was not something Ren could give?

What if the bridge demanded patience and she, with her modern insistence on immediate answers, would always be tempted to pull too hard?

Hana closed the notebook.

She needed to move.

She needed air.

So she left.

Kanazawa's streets were still damp, the sky low. Shops were opening quietly, rolling up shutters, setting out small signs. A man in an apron swept his doorstep as if that act alone could keep the world tidy.

Hana walked toward the shrine again.

Not because she expected something to change.

Because she needed to see the lantern.

Because proof had a weight, and she needed to feel it in her hands again.

At the shrine, the air smelled of cedar and cold earth.

There were a few visitors this time--two elderly women speaking softly, a young couple holding hands.

Hana's pulse jumped.

She hadn't considered this.

People.

Eyes.

Ren had carved the sign where it looked like damage.

But what if someone still noticed?

What if a caretaker decided to repair it?

What if a tourist traced it out of idle curiosity?

Hana walked down the lantern path with her tote held close.

She approached the lantern.

Her heart thudded.

The mark was still there.

Three short lines, crossing.

In the lantern's shadowed belly.

It looked like nothing.

It looked like everything.

Hana did not touch it.

Not with people nearby.

Instead she stepped back and looked at the lantern as a whole.

It was old, but not ancient in a museum way. It was old in a living way--moss at its base, weather softening its edges, repairs done without fanfare.

A thing that had survived because no one thought it was important enough to destroy.

Hana swallowed.

She turned away.

As she walked back up the steps, she caught herself glancing at the cedar roots.

At the stones.

At the shapes that might hide other signs.

Her mind wanted more.

More proof.

More connection.

More certainty.

Hana pressed her fingers to her palm.

No.

She had to stay careful.

Proof was heavy.

If she carried too much of it, she might drown.

She left the shrine and walked to a small café nearby--quiet, minimal, the kind of place where people read alone without being judged.

She ordered coffee and sat by the window.

Her laptop waited in her bag.

She didn't open it.

Instead, she watched rain clouds drift.

In the café, someone turned a page of a book.

The sound reminded Hana of the notebook.

Paper.

Lives flattened into pages.

A sudden thought struck her.

If Ren was real--if he lived in Tenbun 20--then he existed in history.

As a name.

As a footnote.

Or perhaps not at all.

Hana's stomach tightened.

She had only begun to consider Ren as a person.

Not as a fact.

But if the bridge could change time, then the act of speaking to him might already be rewriting something.

Her breath slowed.

She opened her phone.

She searched.

Not for Ren.

Not yet.

For Tenbun.

For Kaga.

For Kanazawa's Sengoku history.

The articles and pages blurred together: Ikko-Ikki uprisings, shifting control, warlords and temples, names and years.

Hana's modern brain tried to map it into a timeline.

Then she stopped.

This was dangerous.

Not because knowledge was bad.

Because knowledge could become temptation.

If she learned too much, she might begin to intervene.

To "help."

To prevent.

To fix.

And fixing, Ren had warned, was a sword.

Hana locked her phone.

She sat back.

Her reflection in the café window looked tired.

But her eyes were awake in a new way.

By afternoon, she returned to the apartment and forced herself through work.

She answered emails. She drafted the director summary. She set reminders.

Her supervisor sent another message:

**Supervisor (15:21):** Amazing as always.

Hana stared at it.

Her chest felt hollow.

She realized something.

She had been praised her entire adult life.

And yet she had never felt seen.

Ren, with his careful brush-strokes, had seen her exhaustion and called it war.

He had carved proof into stone to confirm her existence.

Her supervisor had never even asked if she was okay.

Hana closed her laptop.

She sat in silence.

The notebook waited.

Night came.

Kanazawa's streetlights warmed the wet pavement. The city tucked itself in. The apartment darkened.

At 11:50, Hana made tea.

She turned off her overhead light.

She sat at the table.

She placed the notebook before her like an offering.

And she waited.

At midnight, ink appeared.

Ren's frame formed.

Sharp lines, lacquered certainty.

Then brush-strokes began.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana stared at the last line.

*A hand that does not shake on a battlefield shook before this notebook.*

Her throat tightened.

Ren had confessed fear.

Not the fear of battle.

The fear of connection.

The fear of a path opening.

Hana's fingers hovered over her pen.

Ren had asked: *Has anything changed for you?*

Hana thought of the museum.

The exhibits.

The placards.

Everything had looked normal.

But how could she be sure?

History did not announce itself when it shifted.

Small changes could pass unnoticed.

A name on a plaque.

A line in a catalog.

A date.

Hana swallowed.

She didn't want to become obsessed.

But Ren's words had named the risk.

*A path is made.*

*People pass through.*

Good things. Bad things.

Hana flipped to a fresh page.

She wrote carefully.

When Hana finished, her pen tip lingered.

She wanted to write something else.

Something simple.

Something like: *I'm glad you exist.*

But that felt like a blade too sharp.

She closed the notebook.

Her tea had gone cold again.

Outside, Kanazawa's wind pressed against the window.

Hana lay down on her futon and stared at the ceiling.

She thought of Ren's hand shaking.

A man who had survived battle.

Shaking because he had confirmed a stranger across time.

Hana's chest tightened.

Proof had weight.

And now she carried it.

Somewhere between sleep and waking, one last thought pressed into her mind like the groove on stone:

A path is made.

People pass through.

Good things.

Bad things.

And Hana, lying alone in a modern room, realized the terrifying truth.

This bridge was no longer only a secret.

It was a choice.
