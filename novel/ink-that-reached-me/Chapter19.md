## Chapter 19 -- The Last Pages Before the Cut

Hana began to dread the hum.

That realization shamed her.

For weeks she had longed for it--the faint vibration through cloth, the moth-wing insistence that meant Ren had left something behind.

Now, whenever the hum came, her stomach tightened.

Because every new page was proof that danger was moving.

Every new page was a sign that the bridge was being used as a lifeline.

And lifelines snapped.

The day after Ren wrote about footsteps behind him, Hana barely functioned.

She attended meetings on autopilot, voice even, face composed.

She typed sentences that were coherent.

She answered questions.

She smiled once on camera when someone joked about "year-end exhaustion."

No one noticed how her hands shook under the table.

No one noticed the binder on the floor beside her chair, thick now with printed evidence.

No one noticed that history had become her second job.

At lunch she went to the canal bridge and watched the water slide past, dark and steady.

Water didn't care what you wanted.

It moved.

It carried.

It erased.

That night, the notebook hummed at 12:00 exactly.

No delay.

No hesitation.

As if the bridge had decided to breathe on schedule one last time.

Hana sat up so fast her blanket slid off her shoulders.

She retrieved the notebook from the closet with trembling hands and carried it to the table.

She didn't turn on the overhead light.

She didn't make tea.

The small lamp was enough.

Too much light felt like a betrayal.

Hana opened the notebook.

There were pages.

More than usual.

A cluster.

As if Ren had written in advance, leaving a stack of words behind him like supplies.

Hana's throat tightened.

She read.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's stomach dropped.

Footsteps disappeared.

Most dangerous.

Because danger wasn't always loud.

Sometimes it learned to be silent.

She turned the page.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's breath caught.

Someone saw the sign.

Said nothing.

Danger.

Ren had warned her.

A path is made.

People pass through.

Good things. Bad things.

Hana's hands trembled as she turned the next page.

The brush-script looked heavier.

Not messy.

Pressed.

As if the writer had been holding anger down with the pressure of his hand.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana pressed her fist to her mouth.

Protect you.

The words were gentle.

The decision behind them was brutal.

He was preparing to cut.

To sever contact.

Not because he wanted to.

Because someone else had seen the sign.

And silence could be a blade too.

Hana turned the page.

This entry was longer.

The brush-script softened slightly, as if the writer had stepped away from anger and into something quieter.

Hana's vision blurred.

Don't bind me.

I will not bind you.

Live on the far side of the bridge.

That is my wish.

It wasn't a love confession.

It was deeper.

It was a command disguised as tenderness.

A retainer ordering a stranger to survive.

Hana's hands shook as she turned the next page.

The ink was darker.

Newer.

As if written right now.

As if Ren had stopped to write this at the edge of something.

Hana's breath shook.

Same lines.

Paper in two worlds.

A bridge made not only of ink, but of repetition.

Hana turned the next page.

And her throat tightened.

Because the entry was unfinished.

The brush-script began, then stopped.

As if the hand had been interrupted mid-stroke.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

The line ended.

No continuation.

No next page.

Just a sentence cut cleanly at its throat.

Hana stared.

Her hands went numb.

This was it.

This was the cut.

Not death.

Not necessarily.

But a line drawn.

A bridge severed to protect her.

Hana's chest tightened until breathing became difficult.

She stared at the unfinished "If the pages--" and felt something inside her collapse.

All the discipline.

All the restraint.

All the folded fear.

It had been preparation for this.

Being left hanging.

With nothing but an unfinished sentence.

Hana's eyes stung.

She pressed her fist to her mouth, biting down hard enough to taste salt.

She did not pick up her pen.

She did not break the rule.

Ren had cut the bridge.

Breaking the rule now would be screaming after someone who had already shut the door.

Hana closed the notebook.

Her hands were shaking.

She carried it back to the closet and buried it beneath sweaters.

Then she sat on the futon and stared at the wall.

Her breathing came in shallow pieces.

Ren had said:

Silence is not the end.

The bridge remains.

But now silence felt like the end of a world.

Hana thought of the recorded name on her printout.

History writing him.

Public archives updating.

Museum panels reprinting.

And then--nothing.

No more pages.

No more hum.

Just a severed sentence.

Hana swallowed.

She pressed her palm to her chest and folded fear small.

But fear, tonight, did not fold.

It spread.

Like ink on wet paper.

In the darkness of her apartment, Hana understood the cruel logic of Ren's last act.

He had left her the only thing he could leave safely.

A name.

A sign.

Paper proof.

And then he had disappeared into the line.

Not dead.

Maybe.

Elsewhere.

Maybe.

But Hana could not survive on maybes.

Not anymore.

If the bridge would not speak--

then Hana would have to go to the only place the past still spoke aloud.

History.

Records.

Museums.

She would have to find out, in the only way she was still allowed.

By looking.
