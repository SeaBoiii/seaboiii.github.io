## Chapter 7 -- Three Nights, Briefly (Night One)

Hana spent the day practicing disappearance.

Not physically--she still went out to buy food. She still answered two messages from work. She still nodded politely at the cashier as if her life had not split open.

But internally, she tried to make herself smaller.

Less curious.

Less hungry.

Less likely to do something that would leave fingerprints on the bridge.

She did not go back to the shrine.

She did not search for Tenbun history.

She did not open the notebook once in daylight.

It sat in her tote bag, wrapped in cloth, hidden in the closet under a stack of sweaters.

Hana checked it twice anyway.

Not to read.

To ensure it was still there.

The impulse made her feel ashamed.

Ren's world could end because of one wrong movement.

And still she wanted to touch the door.

At 7 p.m., she tried to distract herself by watching television.

A travel program played. People smiled in onsens. A host laughed too loudly. The screen showed food steaming, cutlery clinking.

Hana stared at it without seeing.

At 8 p.m., she opened her laptop, wrote half a summary for the director meeting, then deleted it.

Her mind kept returning to Ren's instruction.

Three nights.

Briefly.

Then silence.

The rule felt like a tight bandage.

Necessary.

Suffocating.

By 11:30 p.m., Hana made tea and turned off her overhead lights.

She sat at the low table with her hands folded, as if waiting for a verdict.

At 11:55, she retrieved the notebook from the closet.

She carried it carefully, the way someone carries an animal that might bite if startled.

She placed it on the table.

She did not open it yet.

She stared at the cover, listening to the apartment's quiet.

Fear has a voice.

A voice calls people.

Hana tried to keep her fear silent by keeping her breathing slow.

At 11:59, she opened the notebook.

The pages were still.

Her last entries waited.

Ren's last warning waited.

She turned to a fresh page.

This was night one.

She was allowed to write.

Briefly.

Hana held her pen and realized she did not know how to be brief.

Her entire life was built on filling spaces--sending explanations, smoothing edges, offering extra.

Ren's rule demanded the opposite.

Say only what was necessary.

Give no one a reason to look closer.

Hana swallowed.

She wrote.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hana's pen hovered.

She wanted to add: *I miss the cedar smell.*

She wanted to add: *I keep thinking of your hand shaking.*

She wanted to add: *I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.*

But those were not brief.

Those were loud.

Those were fear speaking.

She did not add them.

She sat back.

The notebook lay open.

The page looked almost empty.

Hana's chest ached with the restraint.

At 00:07, ink began to appear.

Ren's frame formed on the opposite page, sharp-lined, disciplined.

The brush-script came quickly.

He, too, was obeying the rule.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana stared at the last line.

*That, too, is battle.*

Her eyes burned.

The entry was brief.

But it held her.

Hana pressed her thumb to the edge of the page, grounding herself.

She wanted to write back immediately.

But the rule--three nights, brief--was still in place.

And Ren had already answered what was necessary.

He was safe.

For now.

He had recognized her small victory.

He had named it.

Hana swallowed.

She closed the notebook gently.

Her hands were trembling.

Not from fear.

From the ache of being seen in so few words.

She lay down on her futon and stared into the dark.

Outside, the city's quiet pressed against the window.

Hana listened.

Not for rain.

For footsteps.

For voices.

For anything that might mean the bridge had called someone.

But the night remained still.

And in that stillness, Hana realized something strange.

Silence was not the absence of connection.

Silence was sometimes the shape of care.
