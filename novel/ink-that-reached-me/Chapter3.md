## Chapter 3 -- The Rules of a Door

Hana woke to pale light and a silence that felt newly arranged.

For a moment, she lay still and listened, trying to identify what had changed.

The rain had stopped.

Not entirely--Kanazawa never truly stopped raining. But the steady tapping that had threaded through her night was gone, replaced by a softer sound: wind worrying the edge of the window frame, the distant hum of a city that was awake without urgency.

Hana's body remembered the night before in pieces.

The antique shop's quiet interior. The notebook's weight, too light, too intentional. The ink appearing as she watched, stroke by stroke, like a hand writing in air.

Ren.

Haru.

Her chest tightened at the memory of being named.

She sat up and reached for her phone before she could stop herself.

Three missed calls from a coworker. Six messages from her supervisor. A reminder notification for Sunday's meeting. A calendar alert that she had already acknowledged yesterday.

Her life, impatiently waiting.

Hana stared at the screen until the edges of the icons softened.

Then she set the phone down, face-down, like last night.

The notebook lay on the table where she had left it.

Closed.

Still.

It did not glow. It did not hum.

It looked like what it was: cloth cover, hand-stitched spine, a thing a stranger might overlook.

That made it worse.

Because it meant the world could be broken quietly.

Hana moved to the table and sat. She didn't open it immediately.

She watched it instead, as if it might blink.

Her palms were slightly damp.

She told herself--firmly--that she had dreamed it.

A stress hallucination. An exhaustion trick. A story her brain invented to entertain itself.

Then she remembered the sensation of watching ink form in real time.

No dream had ever moved that slowly.

Hana touched the cover.

It was cool beneath her fingertips.

She opened it.

Her own boxed entries stared back at her: neat pen, modern phrasing, the sincerity she hadn't realized she was capable of at three in the morning.

On the other page, Ren's entry sat inside its sharp-lined frame, as if the notebook itself had decided his era deserved a different architecture.

Hana read his lines again.

The foreignness of her handwriting.

The estate that was quiet but not trustworthy.

*Winters in this land are long.*

And the question he had left at the end:

*Did you mean to write that your world has no war?*

Hana let out a slow breath.

She had answered. She had tried to be careful.

But the larger problem remained.

A door had opened between them.

And Hana, with her modern instincts, wanted to name it.

Define it.

Control it.

If she could make rules, she could survive it.

If she could understand the shape of the bridge, perhaps she could stop herself from falling.

She flipped to a clean page.

Her pen hovered.

Then, instead of writing to Ren, she wrote for herself.

Not in a box.

Just a list, raw and unformatted.

1) The notebook responds at night.

2) The ink appears as if written live.

3) Ren is in Tenbun 20.

4) He is in Kaga.

5) He is a retainer. He said the notebook being found means "no tomorrow."

6) He named me Haru.

7) He chose Ren.

8) He asked about war.

Hana stared at the list.

A sudden thought made her stomach dip.

If the notebook could write across time…

Could it also change time?

She thought of all the stories she'd read growing up--time travel, butterfly effects, tragedies that began with a small kindness in the wrong era.

She thought of Ren's line:

*If it is discovered, heads will roll.*

She could hurt him without meaning to.

The idea made her feel sick.

Hana closed her eyes.

Then she opened them and turned to a fresh page.

She began to write to Ren.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hana sat back.

Writing in the morning felt like writing a letter into a locked drawer.

She didn't know if the notebook would deliver it.

She didn't know if Ren would ever read daylight words.

But the act of writing settled something in her chest.

It gave her a job.

A task with a shape.

And perhaps that was why she found herself leaving the apartment before noon.

Not to sightsee.

Not to shop.

But because Ren had written *Kaga*, and Kaga was not only a province--it was a place.

And Hana was standing in it.

She dressed quickly, pulling on a warm coat and boots. She tucked the notebook into her tote bag, wrapped in a scarf for protection as if it were fragile glass.

Her reflection in the bathroom mirror looked almost normal.

Only her eyes gave her away.

They had the sharpness of someone who had seen something impossible and was now trying to pretend it could be filed away like a receipt.

Outside, Kanazawa was brighter. The rain had rinsed the streets clean. The air smelled of wet stone and early winter.

Hana walked toward a museum without thinking too hard about why.

Museums in Kanazawa were plentiful, and each felt like a different kind of quiet: art, craft, history. She chose one whose banners mentioned local history, Kaga culture, the old province.

Inside, the building smelled of polished wood and climate control.

Hana moved through the exhibits slowly, reading placards with a strange hunger. Not for facts.

For confirmation.

For the reassurance that Kaga was real.

That the province had once held war and retainers and estates.

That Ren's world was not a fantasy he'd invented to trap her.

There were displays of armor. Spears. Helmets with crests. Scrolls written in brush-script that made Hana squint.

She paused in front of a diagram showing old provincial divisions.

Kaga Province.

There it was.

A map that included Kanazawa.

A map that included roads that had been walked by men like Ren.

Hana's throat tightened.

She turned away and wandered into a quieter corner of the exhibit, where a small diorama showed a manor layout--shutters, inner garden, corridors.

*The estate is quiet, but quiet cannot be trusted.*

She imagined Ren writing by firelight, hearing footsteps outside, the notebook hidden perhaps under floorboards or behind a scroll, his hand trained to be steady.

Hana's palms went cold.

She suddenly wanted to protect him in a way that frightened her.

She left the museum and walked without destination.

Kanazawa had districts that preserved their old bones: narrow lanes, stone walls, wooden facades. Hana found herself drawn to those places. She wanted to stand where centuries overlapped.

If there was any point in the city where Ren's world might touch hers, it would be here.

She crossed a small bridge over shallow water and paused, watching the current slip beneath.

Time moved like that too.

Quiet.

Unstoppable.

She kept walking until she reached a shrine she hadn't planned to visit.

It was larger than the one from last night--more traveled, but still not crowded. A line of stone lanterns led up to the main hall. Cedar trees rose tall behind it, their trunks dark and wet.

Hana stood at the base of the steps.

She didn't know why she stopped.

Then she realized it.

Stone lanterns.

A place that could survive.

If she and Ren needed an anchor--something both eras could refer to--then a shrine like this might be it.

A bridge that existed in both times.

Hana climbed the steps slowly.

She ran her fingers lightly along the side of a stone lantern, feeling the cold grit, the texture of carved age. She thought of Ren scratching a mark beneath stone.

She looked underneath.

Nothing.

Of course nothing.

She didn't even know if this shrine existed in his era.

She was grasping.

Still--her chest ached with the urge to try.

Hana stepped into the space beneath the eaves and placed a coin into the offering box.

She bowed.

Not to ask for love.

Not to ask for luck.

She bowed because she didn't know what else to do with the weight of this.

Outside the shrine, she found a small bench beneath a cedar tree.

She sat.

She listened to the wind.

Her phone buzzed.

Hana looked this time.

**Supervisor (12:47):** Are you okay? We need the updates today.

Hana stared at the message.

She almost laughed.

The world didn't care if time had cracked open.

Deadlines remained.

Hana typed a reply with numb fingers.

**Hana (12:48):** Sorry. I'm traveling. I'll send it by tonight.

She sent it before she could rethink.

Then she put her phone away again.

She sat beneath the cedar tree and watched leaves fall.

Somewhere in that slow motion, she realized she had started to think of the notebook as something she needed to return to.

Not because it was a mystery.

Because it was a person.

By evening, Hana returned to the apartment with chilled fingers and aching feet.

She ate convenience store rice balls and miso soup without tasting them.

She opened her laptop and worked with the mechanical precision of habit.

Slides. Data. Corrections.

Her supervisor responded with a thumbs-up emoji.

Hana felt nothing.

At 11:50, she stopped working.

She washed her face.

She poured herself tea.

Then she sat at the table and opened the notebook.

Her daylight entry waited.

No response.

Of course not.

Hana stared at the page anyway.

At 11:59, the air in the room felt like it thickened.

Not physically.

Emotionally.

As if the apartment had leaned closer.

At midnight, ink began to appear.

Not on her page.

On the opposite page, where the notebook seemed to prefer Ren's voice.

The sharp-lined border formed first--Ren's frame.

Then the brush-script began.

Hana watched, helplessly fascinated, as the entry built itself stroke by stroke.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana read the entry twice.

Then three times.

Each line landed like a careful touch.

*Rules protect life.*

*Words resemble swords.*

*Even if you do not intend to cut, they can cut.*

He understood her instinct. He didn't mock it.

He shared it.

And then he proposed something that made Hana's pulse quicken.

*A marker.*

An anchor.

A way to confirm they were speaking from the same map.

Hana's mind immediately began to race.

Kanazawa had countless shrines.

Stone lanterns.

Cedars.

How could she pick one that existed in his era?

How could she be sure?

But Ren had offered a path.

Not a miracle.

A method.

A retainer's logic.

Find a place that lasted.

Mark it.

Confirm.

And then--his question at the end.

*Then what are you fighting?*

Hana stared at that line until her vision softened.

She could have answered easily.

Work.

Expectations.

Loneliness.

But none of those felt like "battle" the way he meant it.

She imagined swords at the door.

She imagined the difference between fear that was loud and fear that lived quietly inside your ribs.

Hana took her pen.

She flipped to a fresh page.

And she wrote.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

When Hana finished, her pen hovered above the page.

She wanted to add more.

Something softer.

Something like: *And I'm scared I'll start needing this bridge too much.*

But she didn't write it.

Because that would be another kind of sword.

She closed the notebook gently.

Outside, Kanazawa's night pressed against the window, deep and damp.

Hana stared at the closed cover and tried to imagine Ren hiding it.

Under floorboards.

Inside a hollow beam.

Wrapped in cloth and tucked behind scrolls.

She imagined him listening for footsteps the way she listened for notification sounds.

Different dangers.

Same tension.

Hana lay down and forced her eyes shut.

Sleep did not come immediately.

But before she drifted, one thought anchored itself in her mind like a promise.

A marker.

A place.

If they could find a single stone that existed in both worlds--

then this bridge would stop being only words.

It would become proof.
