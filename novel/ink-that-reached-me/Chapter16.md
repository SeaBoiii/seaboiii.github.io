## Chapter 16 -- Before and After

Paper did not feel heroic.

It was thin. It tore easily. It yellowed. Ink bled when humidity was wrong. In Kanazawa's winter, paper sometimes curled at the edges as if trying to escape the cold.

And yet Ren had told her:

*Leave paper behind.*

So Hana did.

She became meticulous in a way that surprised her.

She bought clear sleeves for her binder. She bought labels. She wrote dates in neat handwriting at the top right corner of every printout. She stapled pamphlets to pages so they wouldn't slip. She kept a second copy of everything in a manila envelope under her bed.

It was excessive.

It was also the only way she could breathe.

Because the world was editing itself.

And Hana needed at least one medium that resisted revision.

If her phone's metadata could change, then the phone could not be trusted.

If a website could update overnight, then the web could not be trusted.

But paper--

Paper could be held.

Paper could be pinned.

Paper could be proof of what had once existed.

On December 14th, Hana woke up with the strange certainty that something had moved.

Not in her apartment.

Not in the weather.

In the air behind her eyes.

She had begun to recognize the sensation.

The same faint wrongness she felt the night Ren broke silence.

A draft through a door that should have stayed closed.

Hana lay in bed for a long moment, staring at the ceiling.

Her chest felt tight.

Her mouth was dry.

She told herself not to check.

Not to feed the impulse.

But the impulse was not curiosity.

It was survival.

If reality was rewriting, then ignoring it did not stop the rewrite.

It only made you blind.

Hana got up.

She made tea.

She sat at the low table.

She opened her binder.

The clear sleeves reflected the room's dim light.

Her "BEFORE / AFTER" section was growing.

She flipped to the museum exhibit printout from December 10th.

**Marginalia and Codes in Kaga Records**

The page was there.

The three-line sign named.

The caption referencing *michibito*.

Hana traced the printed words with her eyes.

Then she picked up her phone.

She opened the museum website.

She navigated to the same exhibit page.

She expected it to match.

She expected the comfort of alignment.

Instead, Hana's stomach dropped.

The exhibit page had changed.

Not obviously.

Not in a way a casual viewer would notice.

But Hana noticed.

Because she had paper.

The heading was the same.

The gallery images were the same.

But the curator's note--the paragraph that named the sign--was different.

The phrase "San-sen no shirushi" was still present.

But the caption underneath the image no longer used *michibito*.

It used another term.

A more formal one.

"使者"

*Shisha.* (Messenger.)

Hana stared.

Road person.

To messenger.

The shift was small.

A historian's choice.

A curator's revision.

Normal.

Possible.

Except Hana's printed page still said *michibito*.

And Hana remembered the night Ren had written:

*A duty is a road. A road changes a face.*

She stared at the phone screen.

Then at the paper.

Then back.

Her hands began to shake.

The world had changed after she printed it.

Which meant one of two things.

Either the museum had quietly updated their wording.

Or reality was rewriting itself in multiple drafts.

And Hana, with her binder, was the only one holding the previous version.

Hana swallowed.

She took a screenshot of the current page.

Then she saved it.

Then she printed it.

The printer whirred, spitting out a new page.

Hana laid the new printout beside the old.

Two versions of reality.

Side by side.

The older one called him road-person.

The newer one called him messenger.

Hana's throat tightened.

It wasn't proof of Ren.

Not definitively.

But it was proof of change.

And change meant pressure.

Pressure meant the seam was being pulled.

Hana opened her private notes.

She wrote a new box.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hana stared at her note.

Her breathing felt shallow.

The city outside was quiet.

Kanazawa did not know it had changed.

Or perhaps it did, and simply kept its voice down.

That afternoon, Hana went to the museum.

Not to seek comfort.

To test the physical world.

The museum lobby looked the same.

The air smelled the same.

The receptionist stamped tickets.

Nothing screamed wrong.

Hana walked directly to the temporary exhibit.

She stood in front of the panel she had photographed on December 10th.

She found the line she remembered.

But it wasn't there.

The panel now used the more formal term.

"使者"

Messenger.

Hana's stomach twisted.

The physical panel had updated too.

Not a website revision.

Not an online edit.

A real printed display.

Hana stared.

A museum did not reprint panels overnight for no reason.

But maybe they had.

Maybe the curator had found a better translation.

Maybe the volunteer clean-up had prompted a new research note.

Maybe.

Maybe.

Hana's mind kept offering maybes like bandages.

But her body knew.

This was the seam.

This was the bridge pressing on the world.

Hana stepped back from the panel.

Her phone buzzed.

A message from her friend in Tokyo.

**Friend:** You're still in Kanazawa?? You okay??

Hana stared.

Her fingers hovered.

She could not explain.

She could not tell anyone about a notebook that rewrote history.

She typed:

**Hana:** I'm okay. Just resting.

Then she put the phone away.

She felt alone in a new way.

Not just lonely.

Isolated by knowledge.

She left the exhibit and wandered into a quieter gallery.

She sat on a bench in front of a ceramic display.

A bowl glazed deep blue.

A small crack repaired with gold--kintsugi.

Hana stared at it.

A break.

A repair.

A seam made visible.

The bowl didn't pretend it hadn't been broken.

It made the break part of its beauty.

Hana swallowed.

She wondered if this was what the bridge would do to her.

Not erase her fractures.

Make them visible.

Make them meaningful.

That night, the notebook hummed at 12:04.

Hana retrieved it and opened it with trembling hands.

More pages.

Ren's frame.

Road between provinces.

Name unwritten.

She read.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's throat tightened.

Do names change.

Yes.

People married.

People chose new identities.

People reinvented.

People hid.

But in Hana's world, changing a name was not usually a matter of survival.

In Ren's world, it was.

Hana turned the page.

The next entry was shorter.

The brush-script looked slightly uneven, as if written while moving.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's breath caught.

He left the sign on paper too.

Ren was doing what he had told her to do.

Leaving paper behind.

Camouflaging.

Anchoring.

Not with his name.

With the mark.

Hana closed the notebook gently.

Her hands trembled.

On her table, her two museum printouts sat side by side.

Road person.

Messenger.

Two versions.

Two names.

And Ren--who held two names now--had just mirrored the shift.

Hana pressed her palm to her chest.

Fear folded small.

Held.

She whispered, barely audible:

"Stone remains."

Then she added, even softer:

"And so will I."
