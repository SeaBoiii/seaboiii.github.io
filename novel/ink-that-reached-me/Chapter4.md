## Chapter 4 -- The Stone That Remains

Morning in Kanazawa arrived like a careful apology.

The sky stayed pale, the clouds low and soft-edged, but the rain had loosened its grip. Streets that had shone black the night before now looked gray and clean, rinsed of yesterday's footsteps. In the alley outside Hana's rental, a delivery truck rattled past with the gentleness of someone trying not to wake a sleeping house.

Hana sat at the low table with her phone beside her, face-up this time.

She had answered work in the night like a person returning to shore after almost drowning. She had sent slides. She had sent data. Her supervisor had responded with a single: *Thanks!* as if nothing else existed.

Hana stared at that message and felt a slow, sour laugh rise in her throat.

The world did not change because she had spoken to a man across centuries.

It simply demanded the next thing.

The notebook lay wrapped in a scarf, tucked into her tote bag like contraband.

She hadn't opened it since writing her last entry.

Not because she didn't want to.

Because she was afraid of how much she did.

Ren's suggestion had taken root in her mind overnight.

*A marker.*

A physical sign.

Something both worlds could point to.

Something that existed outside words.

If she could find it--if she could run her fingertips over a carving he had made--then her life would never return to its previous shape.

The thought both steadied and frightened her.

Hana stood and began to prepare as if she were going on a mission.

She dressed warmly: thermal layer, sweater, coat. She tied her hair back. She packed a small flashlight, a piece of chalk, a phone charger, and a small hand towel. Then, after hesitation, she slipped a thin pair of gloves into her pocket.

Not for cold.

For stone.

The shrine she had visited yesterday rose in her memory: its lanterns, its cedars, the way the air had smelled like wet bark and incense.

But Kanazawa had many shrines.

How could she choose the right one?

She needed something older.

Something that would have existed in Tenbun 20.

Something that had survived wars, fires, modern development, the casual destruction of time.

She opened her laptop and searched quietly.

Ancient shrines in Kanazawa. Kaga Province shrines established before the Edo period. Stone lanterns dating back centuries.

The internet offered lists, photographs, tourist write-ups.

Most were too polished. Too famous.

Hana didn't want crowds.

She wanted a place that would still have been standing in Ren's era--not because it was protected by fame, but because it was rooted.

After an hour of searching, she found a name repeated in old references.

A shrine tied to local history.

Not grand.

But old.

Its grounds were said to have cedars that had stood for hundreds of years.

Hana stared at the photos.

Stone lanterns lined a path.

Moss covered their bases.

A few comments mentioned how quiet it was on weekdays.

Hana closed her laptop.

The decision settled in her like a weight.

She picked up her tote bag.

And left.

The walk took her through a district where old and new pressed shoulder to shoulder. Modern houses with clean siding stood beside wooden facades with latticed windows. A vending machine glowed beside a stone wall greened with moss.

Kanazawa didn't hide its time layers.

It wore them.

As Hana walked, she kept catching herself listening.

Not for footsteps.

For… something else.

The city sounded normal.

Bicycles. Distant traffic. A child laughing.

And yet Hana's nerves were tuned like strings.

Because she carried a bridge in her bag.

At the shrine entrance, a torii stood dark against the pale sky.

Hana paused beneath it.

The air inside the grounds felt different.

Cooler.

Heavier.

As if the space held its own weather.

She climbed the stone steps slowly, letting her breathing align with her pace.

There were no tourists.

Only an old man sweeping fallen leaves with patient strokes.

The sound of the broom against stone was oddly soothing.

Hana bowed at the offering box, dropped a coin, and pressed her palms together.

She didn't pray for herself.

She didn't know what she wanted.

Instead, she prayed for caution.

For restraint.

For a mind that would not turn this bridge into a weapon.

Then she walked down the lantern-lined path.

The stone lanterns were weathered, their carved edges softened by time. Moss clung to their bases like quiet ownership. Some had cracks repaired with darker stone.

Hana stopped at the first lantern and crouched.

She peered beneath it.

Nothing.

Of course.

Ren had not carved anything yet.

She didn't even know if this was the right place.

She moved to the next lantern.

And the next.

Her knees began to ache.

She put on her gloves.

Cold stone seeped through anyway.

She told herself she was being ridiculous.

Even if the notebook was real, even if Ren was real, the idea that they could coordinate a carving across centuries was… too much.

Time didn't work like that.

And yet.

The notebook had already proven time could be persuaded.

Hana stood and looked around.

Beyond the lanterns, cedars rose thick and dark, their trunks straight like pillars. The ground beneath them was soft with fallen needles.

Ren had written: *Under a stone. Within the belly of a lantern. At the root of a cedar.*

Hana walked toward the cedars.

The path narrowed, the air cooling as she entered the trees.

The sound of the city faded.

Even her own footsteps sounded muffled.

She stopped at the base of the largest cedar she could find.

Its trunk was wide enough that Hana could not wrap her arms around it. The bark was ridged and damp, smelling of earth and old rain.

She crouched and looked at the roots.

They surfaced in thick veins, disappearing into soil dark with moisture.

Hana's gloved fingers brushed the root line.

Then she hesitated.

If Ren carved a sign here, it might still be visible.

But it might also be noticed by someone else.

A caretaker.

A priest.

A curious visitor.

Would her insistence on proof put Ren at risk?

Hana swallowed.

Ren had suggested it.

He had proposed the method.

So perhaps he had already weighed the danger.

Hana took out the chalk.

Not to mark the tree.

Just to lightly dust the underside of the lantern bases--something that would disappear with the next rain, but might reveal grooves.

She returned to the lantern path.

She chose one lantern slightly off to the side, partially hidden by shrubs. Not the first one visitors would touch. Not the most obvious.

She crouched.

She dusted the underside with chalk, her hands moving like a forensic technician.

Nothing.

Her heart sank.

She moved to another lantern, deeper along the path.

Dusted.

Nothing.

Hana swallowed, annoyance rising.

It wasn't frustration at Ren.

It was frustration at herself--for believing, for wanting, for hoping.

She stood, dusting chalk from her gloves.

Then she noticed something.

Not on the underside of the lantern.

On its side.

A small irregularity in the stone.

A groove.

Hana leaned closer.

It could have been a natural crack.

It could have been a chip.

But the line had intention.

A curve that didn't match breakage.

Hana's pulse quickened.

She brushed chalk across the groove.

The line sharpened.

A shape emerged.

Not a letter.

Not a symbol she recognized.

Just a simple mark: three short strokes intersecting like a tiny star--subtle enough to be dismissed as damage, but deliberate enough to be repeated.

Hana froze.

Her throat tightened.

Her mind tried to be rational.

It could have been carved by anyone.

It could have been old.

It could have been meaningless.

But the mark was too neat.

Too restrained.

Like someone trained to leave signs without attracting attention.

Hana stood quickly and looked around.

No one was watching.

The old man sweeping leaves was far away, his broom sound faint.

Hana bent again, closer this time.

She touched the mark lightly with a gloved finger.

Stone.

Cold.

Real.

Her chest tightened.

She pulled off her glove and ran her bare fingertip over it.

The groove caught her skin.

A small, undeniable sensation.

Her eyes stung.

Not from cold.

From something in her that had been holding itself rigid for too long.

If Ren had carved this, then he had stood here.

Not in her time.

In his.

If he had stood here, then the worlds overlapped.

Not metaphorically.

Physically.

Hana sat back on her heels.

The shrine grounds blurred slightly.

She pressed her fingers to her mouth, breathing shakily.

Then, almost violently, her brain tried to protect her by returning to doubt.

She didn't know the mark.

She didn't know Ren's carving style.

She didn't even know if this lantern existed in Tenbun 20.

This could still be coincidence.

Hana swallowed.

She needed confirmation.

Not just a mark.

A matching intention.

She reached into her tote bag.

She pulled out the notebook.

Not here.

Not in public.

Her heart pounded.

But the shrine's corner was empty.

The lantern path had no visitors.

Hana sat behind the lantern, shielding the notebook with her body like she was hiding contraband.

She opened it.

The pages were still.

Daylight.

No ink moved.

But her own writing waited.

Ren's entries waited.

Hana flipped to the page where she had asked:

*Tell me what to carve. A simple mark that won't be noticed by others, but will be undeniable to me.*

No reply.

Not yet.

Hana's throat tightened.

Of course Ren would reply only at night.

Of course the notebook breathed only then.

Hana closed it again and tucked it back into her tote.

She stood and looked at the lantern.

She looked at the mark.

Three intersecting strokes.

She memorized it.

Not the shape.

The feeling of it.

The way it caught her skin.

The way it made her heart stutter.

She put her glove back on.

Then she bowed toward the shrine hall.

Not as thanks.

As acknowledgement.

Because if this mark had truly come from Ren's hand, then something sacred had happened here.

Not in the religious sense.

In the human sense.

She walked back down the steps slowly.

The old man sweeping looked up briefly as she passed.

His gaze slid over her face, then away.

Hana wondered if she looked different.

If she looked like someone who had touched a truth too big for her body.

She returned to the apartment in late afternoon, hands still tingling.

She tried to distract herself with mundane things.

She ate.

She showered.

She responded to a few work messages.

Her supervisor sent another thumbs-up.

Hana felt like screaming.

Instead, she waited.

Because that was what the notebook had taught her.

Wait for night.

Wait for the bridge to breathe.

By 11:40, she had made tea and turned off her overhead lights.

She left only a small lamp on, the apartment's corners soft with shadow.

She sat at the low table.

She placed the notebook in front of her.

Her hands hovered over it.

Then she opened it.

Her entry waited.

Ren's entry waited.

The pages were silent.

Hana watched the clock.

11:57.

11:58.

11:59.

At midnight, ink began to appear.

Not on Hana's page.

On the next blank space, where Ren's frame formed itself like a practiced ritual.

The sharp border completed.

Then the brush-script began.

Hana's heart pounded.

She watched the words come, stroke by stroke.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's vision blurred.

Not because she couldn't read.

Because the notebook had just confirmed what her fingertips had already known.

Three short lines.

Crossing.

Not a character.

Carved on the side.

In the lantern's shadowed belly.

Hana's breath came out in a quiet, broken laugh.

She pressed her palm to the page as if she could steady herself.

Ren had gone.

He had slipped from his estate.

He had risked punishment.

Just to carve a sign.

Just to confirm she existed.

Hana's chest ached with something sharp and warm.

And suddenly the mark on the stone lantern wasn't just proof.

It was effort.

It was a retainer stepping into cold night to touch a world that shouldn't exist.

Hana swallowed.

Her hands trembled as she turned to a blank page.

She wrote, words crowding her pen.

║                                                              ║
║ You risked punishment to confirm me.                          ║
║                                                              ║
║ I don't deserve that, but I'm holding it anyway.             ║
║                                                              ║
║ The shrine you described--cedars, mossy steps, lantern path--  ║
║ it exists here too. I was there today.                       ║
║                                                              ║
║ When I realized it might be your shrine, I felt something in ║
║ my chest loosen. Like my world finally had a seam where      ║
║ something impossible could fit.                              ║

║ Our bridge has a map now.                                    ║

║ I'm frightened of what that means. But I'm also--             ║
║                                                              ║
║ relieved.                                                    ║

║ Please tell me you got back safely.                           ║

When Hana finished, she sat very still.

Her tea had gone cold.

Her hands were warm.

The notebook lay open between them, a bridge that now had coordinates.

Outside, Kanazawa's wind scraped softly against the window.

Hana looked at Ren's entry again.

*Then your battle is a battle too.*

Her throat tightened.

No one in her modern life had ever said that.

No one had ever granted her exhaustion the dignity of being called war.

Hana closed the notebook slowly.

Not because she wanted to shut him out.

Because she suddenly understood the danger of leaving a bridge open.

And because somewhere, in another century, a man had carved a sign into stone just to prove he could reach her.

She needed to treat that kind of effort with reverence.
