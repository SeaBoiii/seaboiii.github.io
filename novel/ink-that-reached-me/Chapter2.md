## Chapter 2 -- Firelight, and the Name You Don't Say

Hana did not sleep.

She tried--she truly tried. She lay on her futon with the lights off, as if darkness alone could convince her that what she'd seen at the table was only a trick of exhaustion. She closed her eyes and listened to the rain, counting the seconds between heavier drops the way her mother used to count thunder when she was a child.

But the notebook sat on the low table like a living thing.

Even with the cover shut, Hana could feel it, the way you can feel someone staring at the back of your neck. The apartment's quiet had shifted. Not louder. Not scarier.

Just… aware.

At 2:14 a.m., she gave up.

She padded barefoot across the tatami-like floor, the air cold against her ankles. The kettle was still on the stove from earlier. Her tea had gone lukewarm and flat. She didn't bother reheating it.

She sat at the table and stared at the notebook.

The brush-script lines were still there.

They didn't fade. They didn't smudge. They didn't look like ink that had dried.

They looked like ink that had just decided to exist.

> ……読めるのか。

*…Yomeru no ka.* (…You can read it.)

> これは、誰の手だ。

*Kore wa, dare no te da.* (Whose hand is this?)

Hana read them again anyway, like repetition might change the outcome.

Her heart kept insisting it was impossible.

But impossibility had already arrived. It sat on her table. It asked questions.

She forced herself to breathe slowly.

If the notebook could write back, then her panic would be useless. It would not help her understand. It would not protect her.

So she did what she always did when the world became uncertain.

She tried to make rules.

Her pen hovered above the page.

Then she stopped.

Because she wasn't sure if she should write at all.

The shopkeeper's voice returned to her.

*If it speaks, answer carefully.*

Hana swallowed.

She looked at the brush-script again.

The first line felt… cautious.

Not aggressive.

Not demanding.

Just startled.

And the second line--

*Whose hand is this?*

It wasn't a threat.

It was confusion.

Hana's fingers tightened around her pen. The tip touched the paper lightly.

She began to write.

She stared at the boxed entry until her eyes blurred.

Then she waited.

Nothing happened.

Minutes passed.

Hana exhaled through her nose, a tight, humorless sound.

Of course it wouldn't answer immediately. Of course it would not behave like a text message. Her mind was still reaching for familiar rules.

She sat back.

Her phone buzzed again--work, surely, or perhaps a friend in Tokyo who had noticed her online status earlier.

Hana didn't look.

She stared at the notebook instead.

At 2:29 a.m., a new brush-stroke appeared.

Not all at once.

Not in a sudden magical flash.

It formed slowly, stroke by stroke, as if an unseen hand was writing in real time on the page.

Hana's breath caught.

She watched the ink shape itself into characters with careful discipline.

Then a full line sat there, still slightly glossy.

> ……見える。

*…Mieru.* (…I can see it.)

Another line followed.

> これは、夢ではないのか。

*Kore wa, yume de wa nai no ka.* (Is this not a dream?)

Hana gripped the edge of the table.

The ink continued.

And then, as if the writer had decided something, the handwriting steadied.

The brush-script became more confident.

Not hurried.

Controlled.

Like someone who had been trained to keep their hand steady even when afraid.

The page filled.

Hana watched until the last stroke ended.

Then she realized her throat hurt.

She had been holding her breath.

The writing was in Japanese, but it was… older. The structure felt more formal. Some words were archaic enough that Hana had to read twice, letting context do the work.

At the bottom, a single character--like a seal.

Not a name.

Just a mark.

Hana swallowed.

Then, very carefully, she turned to a blank page.

She wrote again.

The notebook did not respond right away.

Hana waited.

The rain softened. The wind shifted. Somewhere outside, a car passed on wet road, the sound briefly rising like a wave and then fading.

In the quiet, Hana became aware of how alone she was in the apartment.

How alone she always was, even in Tokyo.

The notebook had done something terrifying.

But it had also done something else.

It had answered.

No one answered her anymore without needing something.

The thought struck her so sharply she had to look down.

Her eyes landed on her boxed writing.

*If this is dangerous, we can be careful.*

She hadn't realized she'd written that with such certainty.

As if she already wanted to keep him safe.

At 3:03 a.m., the brush-script appeared again.

Not on Hana's latest entry, but on the page where the question had first been written--where the old ink sat.

Hana flipped back.

More lines had formed beneath the earlier ones.

The writing was denser now, like a person finally deciding to speak.

Hana read slowly.

Some phrases felt old. Some words used characters she hadn't seen since school textbooks.

But the meaning was clear enough to make her stomach turn.

It said:

> 私は加賀の者だ。

*Watashi wa Kaga no mono da.* (I am of Kaga.)

Kaga.

A province.

A word that belonged to history books.

The writing continued.

It described a life of duty. A lord. A household. A gate that had been repaired after a fire. Rice measured carefully. Men leaving and not returning.

And then the line that made Hana's blood go cold:

> 天文二十年。

*Tenbun nijū-nen.* (The 20th year of Tenbun.)

Hana's mind did the conversion automatically.

Tenbun.

A Japanese era name.

Tenbun 20 was… mid-1500s.

Sengoku period.

War.

Hana pressed her fingertips to her lips.

It couldn't be.

It couldn't be real.

And yet the ink looked wet.

The writing continued.

> 名は書けぬ。

*Na wa kakenu.* (I cannot write my name.)

> もし見つかれば、首が飛ぶ。

*Moshi mitsukareba, kubi ga tobu.* (If it is discovered, heads will roll.)

Hana's hands went numb.

The last line was quieter.

Not less dangerous.

Just… human.

> そなたは、誰だ。

*Sonata wa, dare da.* (And you… who are you?)

Hana stared at that line until her eyes stung.

*Sonata.*

An old form.

Intimate, in a way she could not explain.

She forced herself to breathe.

If he was truly in the Tenbun era--if he was truly in the Sengoku period--then the notebook was not only a door.

It was a bridge across centuries.

And if he was a retainer--if he served a lord--then the smallest wrong word could get him killed.

Hana swallowed.

She flipped to a clean page.

She began to write, slower this time, choosing each sentence like it had weight.

The ink did not appear immediately.

Hana waited until the clock read 03:44.

Her eyes burned.

Her body felt heavy.

And then, at last, brush-strokes began to form.

Not on Hana's page.

On the next blank page--like the writer preferred to speak in their own space.

The new entry arrived with a different rhythm.

The handwriting was careful, formal. The lines were evenly spaced, as if the writer had been trained.

And the box that formed around it--Hana's breath caught--

It wasn't hers.

The notebook itself seemed to choose a different frame.

Not her neat pen-lines.

But something older.

Sharper.

Like a lacquered border.

Hana stared as the box completed itself.

Then the entry began.

Hana stared at the entry.

The notebook had not only answered.

It had named her.

Haru.

Spring.

Her chest tightened in a way that surprised her.

He had read "Hana" and decided it was too soft. Too vulnerable.

Or perhaps he had decided to protect her by turning her into something else.

Haru.

A season.

A promise.

And he had chosen "Ren."

Lotus.

A flower that grew from mud.

Hana ran her thumb along the edge of the page without touching the ink.

A retainer.

A man sitting by firelight, rain beyond shutters, writing in a notebook that could get him killed.

And yet he was asking about war.

Hana's mouth was dry.

She flipped to a new page and began to write, slower than before.

She needed to be honest.

But honesty could be a weapon.

She chose her words with care.

The moment her pen left the paper, fatigue crashed over her.

Her body remembered it was human.

Her eyes stung. Her shoulders ached. The cold in the apartment had seeped into her bones.

She looked down at her boxed words.

*If the rain is beyond your shutters too, then we are under the same sound.*

It felt foolish.

And yet it was true.

Hana closed the notebook gently.

As if the bridge might break if she slammed it.

She went back to her futon and lay down.

This time, sleep came.

Not because she was calm.

Because her body had no choice.

The last thing she heard before the world went dark was rain.

And the faint sense--terrifying, impossible, strangely comforting--

that somewhere, far across time, a man by firelight could hear it too.
