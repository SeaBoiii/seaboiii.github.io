## Chapter 6 -- When Something Is Found

On the sixth day of Kanazawa, Hana began to notice how quickly habits formed.

Not the obvious ones--waking, washing, checking the weather. The smaller ones. The invisible ones.

How her eyes went to the low table first thing each morning, even before she reached for her phone.

How she measured time not by meetings but by midnight.

How she began to keep her evenings empty, as if she were protecting a private ceremony.

It scared her.

Because rituals became attachments.

And attachments, in the wrong hands, became knives.

Hana spent the morning doing work that made her feel like an empty vessel.

She summarized numbers for a director meeting. She polished sentences until they sounded effortless. She answered questions with emojis she did not feel.

At 10:37, her supervisor wrote:

**Supervisor:** Can you also take the minutes? You're so reliable.

Reliable.

Hana stared at the word.

In Ren's world, reliable meant a man who would not betray his lord.

In Hana's world, it meant a person everyone could lean on until they forgot the person could feel pain.

She typed: *Sure.*

Then deleted it.

Then typed again.

This time she wrote:

**Hana:** I can't take minutes today. I can do the summary and follow-up, but not both.

She hit send before her courage could evaporate.

Her chest tightened.

Her hands shook.

A minute passed.

Then two.

Then her supervisor replied:

**Supervisor:** Ok.

No apology.

No outrage.

Just a small shift.

Hana stared at the screen.

Her body didn't know how to accept the idea that saying no could be survived.

She set the phone down and exhaled.

Somewhere deep inside, she felt something loosen.

It was not joy.

It was a seam unpicking.

Later, as she ate lunch alone, she realized she wanted to tell Ren.

Not because it was dramatic.

Because he had called her exhaustion a battle.

And today, she had swung a small sword of her own.

But the notebook did not breathe in daylight.

So she held the thought.

And holding, Hana was learning, was its own discipline.

By afternoon, clouds thickened and rain returned, thin and stubborn.

Hana found herself walking again.

Not toward museums.

Not toward cafés.

Toward the shrine.

She told herself she only wanted to check the lantern.

To see if the mark was still safe.

To reassure herself that nothing had changed.

But the truth was simpler.

She missed the place.

She missed the cedar smell.

She missed the feeling of standing somewhere that belonged to both of them.

The shrine was busier than usual.

A small group of schoolchildren in matching caps moved along the path, accompanied by two teachers who herded them gently. Tourists stood under umbrellas, taking photos of the lanterns and the moss.

Hana's stomach tightened.

So many eyes.

So many hands.

She kept her distance, staying at the edge of the path.

She watched.

One of the children ran ahead, laughing, then slowed and leaned toward a lantern.

Hana's pulse spiked.

No.

The child reached out.

Not to the mark.

To the moss.

He poked it once, giggling when it sprang back slightly.

Hana forced herself to breathe.

The teachers called them onward.

The group moved.

The path cleared.

Hana waited until there were fewer people.

Then she walked toward the lantern.

Her steps were careful.

Her gaze flicked around.

She crouched.

And froze.

Someone had tied a small white paper strip near the lantern.

Not on it exactly--on a thin twig wedged beside its base.

A simple omikuji, perhaps, left behind.

But Hana's eyes went to the stone immediately.

The place where the mark was.

She leaned closer.

The groove was still there.

But the chalk she had used before was gone.

Cleaned away by rain.

And now--

Hana's breath caught.

There was a new scratch near it.

A shallow line, not part of the mark. Jagged. Fresh.

Like a fingernail. Like a coin.

Like someone had traced the stone absentmindedly.

Hana's chest tightened.

The mark was subtle.

But subtle was not invisible.

Her mind supplied Ren's line:

*But when something is found, it is found.*

Hana straightened quickly, heart pounding.

She stepped away.

She forced herself to walk back up the steps with the calm pace of a tourist.

Inside, panic flared.

Someone had touched the lantern.

Someone had scratched near the mark.

It might mean nothing.

It might mean everything.

The worst part was that she had no way to know.

She walked to a quiet corner near the shrine hall, sheltered from most of the path's view.

She pulled out her phone and searched:

*Shrine lantern restoration Kanazawa.*

A few pages came up. Maintenance schedules. Community volunteer events.

One listing caught her eye.

A notice on a local community board: a volunteer clean-up for shrine grounds this weekend.

Hana's throat tightened.

Cleaning.

Ren had said the underside was found during cleaning.

The side looked like damage.

But volunteers were curious.

Hands were bored.

Eyes noticed.

Hana swallowed.

If volunteers cleaned the lantern, someone might decide to "fix" the scratch.

They might sand the surface.

They might repaint.

They might chip away moss.

They might erase the mark without knowing.

Or worse.

They might find it and talk.

Hana's hands went cold.

The bridge had a map.

And the map had just attracted footsteps.

Hana walked home quickly in the rain, heart thudding.

Her apartment greeted her with artificial warmth.

She took off her coat.

She washed her hands.

She sat at the table.

The notebook waited.

Daylight still.

No ink.

Hana stared at it until her eyes hurt.

She wanted to rip the cover open and demand answers.

She wanted to write in bold ink: *STOP.*

She wanted to protect him.

But the notebook breathed only at night.

So Hana did the only thing she could.

She prepared.

She wrote her message in her notes app first, revising until every sentence felt restrained.

Ren had taught her that restraint was protection.

By 11:45 p.m., Hana had tea, the room dim, her phone silenced.

She opened the notebook.

She waited.

At midnight, the brush-script appeared.

Ren's frame formed.

The first line came faster than usual, as if written by a hand that had been waiting.

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Hana's stomach dropped.

Ren's estate was restless.

More soldiers.

Strict watch.

A hiding place changed.

And his question--

*Have you noticed something?*

Yes.

Yes, she had.

But the timing--

Hana's palms went damp.

Was it connected?

Had her world's footsteps caused his world's suspicion?

Or was this simply the nature of Sengoku life--unpredictable, paranoid, always on the verge of violence?

Either way, the danger was real.

Hana flipped to a blank page and began to write, her pen slower than her heartbeat.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Hana stared at her boxed words.

The sentence that stood out was the one she hadn't planned to write:

*I can accept not knowing.*

It was true.

It was also a lie.

She could accept not knowing if it meant Ren lived.

But not knowing would hollow her.

She sat very still.

The notebook did not answer immediately.

Hana's breath came shallow.

The minutes stretched.

At 00:31, brush-strokes appeared again.

Ren's frame formed on the next page.

The ink came faster this time.

Not sloppy.

Urgent.

Hana's eyes stung.

Not because he had praised her.

Because he had given her a strategy.

A controlled retreat.

A way to stop without making the stopping suspicious.

Three nights.

Briefly.

Then silence.

Hana's hands trembled.

She could do that.

She could be disciplined.

She could fade.

But the word *silence* landed like a stone in her stomach.

Because silence meant not knowing.

Silence meant not hearing if he survived the next week.

Silence meant letting the bridge close without watching it shut.

Hana swallowed.

She forced her pen to move.

Hana closed the notebook gently.

Her heart hammered as if she had run.

Outside, Kanazawa's wind pressed against the window.

Hana lay down on her futon and stared at the ceiling.

Three nights.

Then silence.

The bridge had become dangerous.

And for the first time since it opened, Hana understood the true cost of care.

Not saving.

Not fixing.

But letting go.
