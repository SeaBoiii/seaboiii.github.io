# **Chapter 11: Forever Begins Tonight**

The gentle evening breeze swept quietly through Marina Barrage, mingling softly with distant sounds of laughter and lapping water. Stars flickered gently overhead, casting delicate lights on the grass where Yusuf had laid out a quiet, cozy picnic—complete with fairy lights, cushions, and her favourite snacks.

It had been exactly one year since that aquarium date, one year since their love quietly, officially blossomed. Tonight, beneath the peaceful Singapore sky, Yusuf’s heart raced quietly with nervous anticipation.

Xin Yi arrived minutes later, eyes widening softly at the sight. “Yusuf, you did all this?”

He smiled shyly, stepping forward gently to take her hand. “I wanted tonight to be special.”

She laughed quietly, eyes sparkling warmly. “You spoil me.”

“Only because you deserve it,” he whispered softly, sincerity quiet but deep.

They sat together beneath the gentle lights, sharing quiet laughter, reminiscing softly about their journey together—shy beginnings, hesitant confessions, heartfelt conversations, quiet courage, and patient love.

“You know, Yusuf,” she admitted softly, gazing upward gently. “I used to think love was complicated—scary. But being with you feels simple. Right.”

He smiled warmly, heart trembling softly with quiet courage. “I’ve felt exactly the same way, ever since you stole my fries.”

She laughed brightly, eyes twinkling. “Forever going to remind me about those fries, aren’t you?”

“Forever and ever,” he teased softly, reaching quietly into his pocket, fingers trembling nervously.

Taking a quiet, steadying breath, he rose carefully onto one knee, heart pounding wildly.

She stared softly, eyes widening gently. “Yusuf...?”

His voice shook quietly, sincerity beautifully evident. “Xin Yi, this journey we’ve walked—together, slowly, bravely, patiently—it’s everything to me. You taught me to trust love again, to be brave, to never give up.”

Tears glistened gently in her eyes as he carefully presented a delicate, simple ring—beautiful yet modest, reflecting her quiet elegance perfectly.

“Will you marry me, Xin Yi?” he whispered softly, voice filled deeply with quiet hope.

She stared gently, tears shimmering quietly, heart trembling with overwhelming warmth. “Yusuf... are you sure? About me, about us?”

His eyes softened beautifully, quiet certainty radiating warmly. “I’ve never been more sure about anything. I promised I’d marry you if you said okay. Tonight, I’m asking officially—say yes, and I promise to spend every day loving you, respecting you, cherishing you.”

Tears cascaded softly down her cheeks, heart swelling quietly with emotion. She gently nodded, smiling tenderly, voice trembling softly, happily. “Yes, Yusuf. Forever yes.”

He slipped the ring gently onto her finger, eyes bright with relieved joy, then rose quickly, pulling her tenderly into his arms, heart racing with profound gratitude.

She whispered quietly into his chest, smiling warmly. “You stole my heart, Yusuf Siddique.”

He laughed softly, hugging her tighter. “Then I promise to take care of it—forever.”

Around them, Marina Barrage quietly celebrated—the gentle ripple of water, distant laughter, soft, twinkling stars—all witnessing the tender beginning of forever between two hearts quietly united.

Later, nestled softly on the blanket, she gently rested against him, tracing small circles on his palm.

“Yusuf,” she whispered softly. “You planned all this alone?”

He chuckled warmly, cheeks flushing shyly. “I might’ve had help from Janice and Amira.”

She laughed brightly, playfully nudging his shoulder. “No wonder it’s perfect.”

He smiled tenderly, brushing her hair gently behind her ear. “You know what’s perfect? Knowing I’ll wake up every day with you beside me.”

She flushed shyly, eyes gently brightening. “Smooth talker.”

“Only for you,” he replied softly, sincerity evident in every word.

Quietly, she smiled upwards, gazing thoughtfully at stars above, her voice gently reflective. “If you told me years ago—when we first met—I’d marry you, I’d never believe it.”

He chuckled softly, nodding gently. “Neither would I.”

She sighed gently, smiling softly. “Yet here we are.”

He leaned in softly, whispering tenderly, “Here we are, and here we’ll stay.”

She smiled warmly, gently kissing him, hearts quietly intertwined beneath the endless, beautiful night sky.

Because from quiet friendship, gentle courage, patient understanding, had quietly grown a love neither expected—yet now couldn’t imagine living without.

Tonight, as gentle waves lapped softly nearby, two hearts quietly celebrated the most beautiful promise they’d ever made—forever bound together, lovingly, quietly, officially.
