# **Chapter 5: Facing the Truth**

The evening air was heavy, tinged with incense, warmth, and the aroma of her mother’s cooking. Shei Er stood hesitantly at her family’s apartment door, heart thudding erratically in her chest. Aleem’s reassuring touch lingered on her arm, gentle and comforting.

“Ready, Xue Er?” he whispered softly, eyes gentle yet steady, radiating quiet strength.

She hesitated briefly, swallowed hard, then nodded. “I think so.”

With a deep breath, she opened the door.

Her mother glanced up from the kitchen, smiling warmly, her eyes twinkling with surprise at Aleem’s presence. Her father stood slowly from his chair in the living room, brows raised, yet welcoming.

“Aleem,” her father greeted warmly, stepping forward to offer his hand in a firm handshake. “What brings you here? Dinner?”

Aleem smiled gently, nodding respectfully. “Yes, Uncle. Hope we’re not troubling you.”

“Nonsense,” her mother laughed softly. “You’re always welcome.”

The small talk flowed easily, familiar and warm, yet beneath it lay an undercurrent of tension. Dinner was served, the table laden with familiar dishes—her mother’s specialty steamed fish, stir-fried vegetables, tofu stew—yet Shei Er could hardly taste the food, her nerves consuming her.

Eventually, as dinner quieted, her mother gently broached the silence. “So, what’s troubling you two?”

Shei Er froze momentarily, heart beating wildly, feeling Aleem’s calm eyes encouraging her quietly.

She steadied her breath, placing her chopsticks down softly, gathering her courage. “Ma, Pa… Aleem and I have something important to tell you.”

Her father’s eyes softened knowingly, while her mother watched carefully, lips pursed in gentle apprehension.

“We’ve decided to be together,” she confessed slowly, voice gentle but unwavering, heart trembling as the words hung heavily between them.

Silence enveloped the table. Her mother exchanged a quiet, anxious glance with her father.

Her father was the first to speak, his voice calm yet deeply thoughtful. “You know what that means, Shei Er?”

She nodded quietly, eyes lowered. “I understand.”

“Does this mean… you’re converting?” Her mother’s voice shook slightly, fearful but compassionate, struggling to mask anxiety behind a fragile smile.

Shei Er’s heart ached. Her mother’s quiet worry pierced deeper than she expected. She glanced at Aleem briefly, whose gentle, supportive eyes reminded her to speak truthfully.

“I’m exploring it. Learning. But yes, Ma, if we marry, I'll embrace Islam.”

Her mother sighed softly, her eyes moistening. “Your faith, your culture—they’re part of who you are. Do you really think you can leave that behind?”

Aleem shifted slightly, carefully choosing his moment. “Aunty, Uncle, I never want Xue Er to lose herself or her heritage. I love her precisely for who she is. Islam is part of my life, yes, but our intention isn’t for her to forget her roots. I promise I’ll never take that from her.”

Her father studied Aleem carefully, his gaze deeply searching, weighing sincerity. Slowly, he nodded with cautious respect. “I appreciate your sincerity, Aleem. But this isn’t a simple decision. You both understand this deeply?”

Aleem met his eyes firmly, nodding with quiet certainty. “We do, Uncle. Completely.”

Her mother stood abruptly, quietly excusing herself into the kitchen, shoulders trembling gently with suppressed emotion. After a long silence, her father spoke again softly, his voice deeply reflective.

“You know, Shei Er, as parents, your happiness is always first in our hearts. But happiness is complicated, especially when two worlds meet. Have you thought deeply about your future—children, traditions, family?”

Shei Er nodded softly, feeling tears well up in her eyes. “Pa, I’ve thought about nothing else. I can’t say I have all the answers. But I know clearly that I love Aleem deeply. He respects who I am, my background, our family. I’m not leaving behind Buddhism completely. Its values—your values—will always guide me.”

Her father sighed gently, thoughtful, quiet for a long moment. “Love is beautiful, but it won’t erase the challenges ahead. Yet, if you’re sure this is your path, then I trust your heart.”

His quiet acceptance brought tears cascading down her cheeks. She rose slowly, moving to hug him tightly. “Thank you, Pa.”

He gently patted her back, whispering softly, “Just promise us you’ll never forget who you are.”

“I promise,” she whispered, voice trembling.

In the kitchen doorway, her mother reappeared quietly, wiping her eyes softly. Her gaze met Aleem’s briefly, hesitant yet kind.

“Look after my girl, Aleem,” she spoke softly, voice fragile yet accepting. “Make sure she never forgets where she came from.”

Aleem rose respectfully, bowing his head gently. “I promise you, Aunty, Uncle—I’ll care for her always. Her heritage, your family, her beliefs—I'll honour them. She'll never lose that.”

Her mother’s eyes softened further, relief visibly easing the lines of worry on her face. She moved slowly forward, embracing her daughter softly, whispering tenderly, “As long as you’re happy.”

Shei Er held her mother tightly, tears streaming down gently, relief and joy mixing with gentle grief. Aleem stood respectfully aside, eyes warm, patient, understanding, as always—her quiet anchor through every storm.

Later, as they stepped out into the cool night air, Aleem gently took her hand, squeezing reassuringly.

“Are you alright, Xue Er?” he whispered softly, eyes full of gentle warmth.

She smiled softly, wiping her eyes gently. “I think so. It’s hard, but… it feels right. Thank you for being here with me.”

Aleem smiled gently, his voice tender. “Always. Wherever your heart leads, I’ll follow.”

She laughed softly, the tension slowly easing from her shoulders. Her parents’ acceptance wasn't complete yet—there would be more conversations, more struggles—but tonight was an important beginning.

She turned, gazing up into the gentle glow of the moon, breathing softly. For the first time in months, her heart felt truly clear, deeply calm, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

Because now, she wasn’t alone.

She squeezed Aleem’s hand gently, whispering softly under her breath, smiling quietly:

*“One step at a time.”*
