# **Chapter 13: The Quiet After the Storm**

The night after the wedding felt strangely silent.

Not empty—just… quieter than it should’ve been, considering the day they’d survived.

Shei Er sat on the edge of their bed, still in her baju kurung, the fabric now softened by hours of movement and emotion. The hotel room was warm, lit by a single lamp. Outside the window, Singapore kept moving—cars, lights, distant voices—like the city didn’t realise two people had just rearranged their entire lives inside one day.

Aleem was in the bathroom, washing up, moving around with that careful, restrained energy he always carried when he was trying not to show worry. She could hear water running, then stopping, then running again—like he was buying time.

She flexed her fingers and stared at the ring on her hand.

It still felt unreal.

A year ago, she was telling him, half-laughing, *“Not like you’re gonna marry me.”*
Tonight, she was sitting in a room with his name on the booking, his clothes on the chair, his scent already settling into the sheets like he belonged there.

A soft knock came from the door.

Shei Er tensed.

Aleem stepped out of the bathroom at the same moment, towel around his neck, eyes narrowing slightly. He looked at her the way he always did when he sensed a threat—not aggressive, not loud, just suddenly focused.

“I’ll get it,” he said quietly.

She watched him cross the room. The door opened just a crack.

Amaliah’s voice came through first. “Aleem. It’s me.”

The tension in his shoulders released, but only halfway. He opened the door wider.

Amaliah stood there in comfortable clothes now, hair tied up, Jun Yu behind her holding a small paper bag, his expression gentle. Amaliah’s eyes flicked past Aleem and landed on Shei Er.

“How are you?” she asked softly.

Shei Er exhaled. “Alive.”

Amaliah smiled, but it wasn’t playful. It was the kind of smile women gave each other when they understood what it cost to arrive at a certain moment.

“We just wanted to check in,” Amaliah said, stepping inside. “Mak couldn’t sleep. She kept asking if you both ate anything.”

Jun Yu lifted the paper bag a little. “We brought something. Bubur. And… some kuih.”

Aleem’s face softened. He took the bag, nodding once. “Thank you.”

Amaliah walked closer to Shei Er and sat beside her on the bed like it was the most normal thing in the world.

“Listen,” Amaliah said, her voice low, “I saw what happened earlier.”

Shei Er’s throat tightened.

The cousins. The bitterness in their voices. The way their envy had slipped into the air like smoke, trying to stain what was holy.

“I’m sorry,” Shei Er whispered before she could stop herself. “I didn’t want… your family—”

Amaliah shook her head. “No. Don’t do that.”

Shei Er blinked.

Amaliah’s eyes were steady. “We don’t apologise for being loved.”

The words landed quietly, but they landed deep.

Jun Yu cleared his throat gently, trying to lighten the atmosphere without forcing it. “When I married into this family, I also heard comments. Not in front of me, but… you know. People are brave when they’re whispering.”

Aleem sat down on the chair opposite them, jaw tight again.

“I should’ve handled it earlier,” Aleem said, voice low. “I should’ve known it would happen.”

Shei Er turned her head slightly, studying him. His anger wasn’t exploding. It never did. With Aleem, anger became a tightness behind the eyes. A quiet pressure in the voice. A restrained violence he refused to let loose.

She reached for his hand.

He looked at her, surprised, then softened.

“I’m not scared of them,” she said, even though her heart still remembered the moment the hall had gone quiet. “But I’m scared of what they’ll try next.”

Amaliah’s expression changed. “That’s why we’re here.”

Aleem frowned. “What do you mean?”

Jun Yu’s gaze flicked to the window, then back. “I heard one of them talking. Near the lift lobby downstairs.”

Aleem’s hand tightened around Shei Er’s.

“What did they say?” Aleem asked, voice sharp now.

Jun Yu hesitated. “They said… ‘We’ll see how long she lasts.’”

Silence.

Not dramatic. Not cinematic.

Just heavy.

Shei Er felt something cold crawl up her spine, and in that second, she realised jealousy wasn’t always loud. Sometimes it was patient. Sometimes it waited until a woman was alone.

Aleem stood.

His posture wasn’t frantic—but it was protective. Like a door closing gently but firmly.

“Which one?” he asked.

Amaliah reached out, grabbed his wrist, and tugged him back down.

“Don’t,” she said. “That’s exactly what they want. A scene. Something to twist into a story.”

Aleem’s chest rose and fell slowly. He looked like he wanted to punch a wall and then apologise to the wall.

Shei Er held his hand tighter.

“I’m okay,” she said quietly, even though she didn’t fully believe it.

Aleem turned to her, eyes searching her face.

“Xue Er,” he said softly, “you don’t have to be strong in front of me.”

Her throat burned.

She forced a small smile. “I’m not… I’m just—”

“You’re trying not to regret it,” he finished gently.

She froze.

Because it was true.

For a moment today, in that hall, with eyes on her and bitterness in the air, a question had flickered through her mind like a sin—

*What if love isn’t enough?*

But then she had looked at Aleem.

At the way he stood beside her, not as someone claiming her, but as someone honouring her.
At the way his mother stepped forward, not with perfection, but with intention.
At the way Amaliah held her chin high, as if daring the world to disagree with love.

And Shei Er knew she was here because she chose this.

Not because she was trapped.

Not because she was pressured.

Because she wanted him.

She swallowed, then nodded slowly. “I don’t regret you.”

Aleem’s eyes softened in a way that made her chest ache.

“Good,” he whispered. “Because I don’t regret fighting.”

Amaliah stood, brushing invisible creases off her clothes. “Okay. Practical mode now.”

Jun Yu nodded. “Tomorrow, you both don’t go anywhere alone. If you go to breakfast, I come with you.”

Aleem frowned. “We’re married. We can’t even eat breakfast alone?”

Jun Yu smiled faintly. “You can. In a month. When the jealous people get bored.”

Amaliah pointed at Shei Er’s phone on the side table. “Also, lock your socials. Some people like to screenshot and stir trouble.”

Shei Er blinked. “You think they’ll do that?”

Amaliah’s eyes didn’t waver. “I’ve seen families tear couples apart without touching them. They just poison the air around them until they can’t breathe.”

Aleem’s jaw clenched again.

Shei Er reached out and pressed her palm gently against his cheek.

The tension in him eased—just slightly.

“Hey,” she whispered, “don’t let them turn our first night into fear.”

Aleem closed his eyes briefly, leaning into her touch like he needed it more than he would ever say.

“I’m sorry,” he murmured.

“Don’t be,” she replied.

Then, softer—softer than she’d ever been—

“Just… stay with me.”

Aleem opened his eyes, and something in them steadied.

“I always will.”

Later, after Amaliah and Jun Yu left, the room settled again into quiet.

Aleem warmed the bubur, placed it on the small table, and sat beside her. They ate slowly, not really hungry but needing something grounded—something normal after a day that felt too big to fit inside their bodies.

Halfway through, Shei Er’s gaze drifted to her right arm.

The tattoos.

For once, she didn’t feel ashamed. She felt… tender. Like they were old scars she had turned into art. Like they were proof she existed long before this marriage.

Aleem noticed her looking.

“What are you thinking?” he asked.

She hesitated.

Then said the truth.

“I’m thinking… I’ve become someone new. But I’m still me.”

Aleem nodded slowly, understanding without needing to question it.

“You don’t have to erase anything,” he said. “Not your past. Not your family. Not your skin.”

She looked at him, surprised.

“You used to be so scared of what people would say,” she whispered.

Aleem smiled faintly, but there was sadness in it too.

“I was scared because I thought love was something people could take away from me,” he said. “I spent eight years convincing myself I was the problem.”

Shei Er’s eyes softened.

“And now?” she asked.

Aleem reached out, slid his fingers through hers.

“Now,” he said quietly, “I’m married to the woman who taught me to hope again.”

A pause.

Then she whispered, almost shy—

“Aleem?”

“Yes, Xue Er.”

She looked down at their hands, then back up at him, eyes shining.

“We survived the hardest day.”

Aleem’s thumb brushed her knuckle, gentle.

“We did.”

“And we still have two chapters left,” she teased weakly, trying to lighten the heaviness.

Aleem blinked, then laughed—an actual laugh, warm and real, breaking the last of the tension.

“Okay,” he said, leaning closer. “Then let’s make them good chapters.”

Shei Er smiled, and in that smile was everything—fear, faith, choice, love.

Aleem pressed his forehead against hers, voice low and certain.

“One step at a time,” he whispered.

And for the first time since the ceremony, Shei Er believed it.

Not because the world was kind.

But because he was.
