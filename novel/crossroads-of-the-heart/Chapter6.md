# **Chapter 6: Aidilfitri Blessings**

Aleem’s family home buzzed warmly on the eve of Hari Raya. The gentle aroma of freshly-cooked rendang, lemang, and pineapple tarts filled the air. Aleem stood beside Shei Er at the entrance, her fingers nervously brushing against his palm. He offered her a reassuring smile.

“Don’t worry, Xue Er. They’ll love you,” he whispered softly.

Her eyes flickered uncertainly, landing briefly on her right arm. Beneath the thin shawl she’d carefully draped over her shoulders, tattoos adorned her skin—beautiful artworks she loved, but now, symbols of potential worry.

Aleem gently squeezed her hand. “Just be yourself.”

They stepped into the living room, and Aleem’s mother, Saadiah, immediately looked up from arranging kuih neatly on a tray, her expression shifting between surprise and hesitant warmth. His father, Jamal, rose slowly from his seat, his welcoming smile tinged with curiosity.

“Aleem, you’re early,” Jamal greeted warmly, his eyes subtly assessing the young woman standing anxiously beside his son. “This must be your friend.”

Aleem stepped forward, his voice calm but proud. “Mak, Ayah, this is Shei Er.”

Shei Er smiled shyly, nodding respectfully. “Selamat petang, Uncle Jamal, Aunty Saadiah.”

His mother’s eyes softened slightly at her politeness, though subtle concern lingered, eyes lingering momentarily upon the shawl covering her arm.

“Welcome,” Saadiah said, gentle yet reserved. “Please, come in. Dinner’s nearly ready.”

Just then, Aleem’s sister, Amaliah, swept into the room cheerfully, her husband Jun Yu closely behind her. Amaliah’s eyes sparkled knowingly upon seeing Shei Er, quickly stepping forward to embrace her warmly.

“Welcome, welcome!” Amaliah said brightly. “Finally, we get to properly meet! Aleem always mentions you.”

Aleem shot his sister a grateful glance. Amaliah had been his confidante, reassuring him when doubt crept in, sharing her own experiences of marrying Jun Yu, a Chinese convert who now seamlessly belonged to their family.

Jun Yu offered a gentle smile and handshake, whispering quietly in Mandarin, “Don’t worry, we’ve all been through this.”

Dinner began pleasantly enough, yet a quiet, inevitable tension hovered delicately between polite conversations. Jamal engaged Aleem in talk about work, while Amaliah and Jun Yu filled the silence with cheerful banter. But Saadiah’s eyes rarely left the shawl on Shei Er’s arm, her gaze quietly anxious.

Finally, midway through the meal, Saadiah spoke softly, voice calm yet cautious. “Shei Er, dear, I notice your shawl—is it just a fashion choice, or are you... covering something?”

Aleem’s heart jumped, but before he could speak, Shei Er answered gently yet courageously, removing the shawl slowly, revealing the elegant patterns inked clearly on her skin.

“Aunty, I have tattoos. They are part of who I am, reflections of my journey,” she admitted quietly, respectfully. “I realise they might concern you.”

Saadiah’s brows knitted briefly, exchanging a brief glance with Jamal. “I must admit, it surprises me,” she said softly, carefully choosing her words. “Have you considered how these tattoos align with Islam?”

Amaliah quietly intervened, voice gentle yet clear. “Mak, remember when Jun Yu first joined our family? People questioned him too. But Islam isn’t only about outward appearances. It’s about intentions, sincerity, and heart.”

Jun Yu nodded softly, offering quiet support. “I understand your concerns, Mak. But Amaliah guided me gently. Islam became my spiritual home, but I’m also proud of my Chinese roots. The same can be true for Shei Er.”

Aleem spoke up gently yet firmly, squeezing Shei Er’s hand reassuringly beneath the table. “Mak, Ayah, I respect your concerns deeply. But I love Xue Er precisely because she’s sincere, respectful, and brave. She’s embraced my world openly and wholeheartedly. She is genuinely learning and growing. Her tattoos don’t change the goodness I’ve always seen in her.”

Jamal sighed thoughtfully, carefully studying both Aleem and Shei Er, quietly reflecting on his own daughter’s marriage. “Your sister faced similar challenges, Aleem. Perhaps we should trust your judgment.”

Saadiah remained quiet for a long moment before finally sighing softly, offering a gentle smile to Shei Er. “My dear, forgive my caution. I only want Aleem’s happiness. I worry, yes—but only because he is precious to me.”

Shei Er’s eyes glistened softly, her voice trembling gently. “I understand, Aunty. Aleem is precious to me too. I promise you—I’ll keep learning, keep respecting, and I’ll do my best to honour your family’s faith and traditions.”

Saadiah’s eyes softened further, visibly moved by the sincerity she heard. “That’s all I could ever ask.”

The tension eased quietly into warmth. Conversation flowed again, quieter but more comfortable. After dinner, as the family began their final Hari Raya preparations, Aleem found Shei Er quietly sitting outside on the porch, gazing thoughtfully at the moonlit sky.

“Are you okay?” he asked gently, sitting beside her.

She smiled softly, eyes bright yet reflective. “Your family is wonderful, Aleem. It wasn’t easy—but it felt important.”

“They love you,” Aleem whispered gently. “I knew they would.”

She chuckled softly, nudging his shoulder playfully. “You were nervous too, admit it.”

He laughed, smiling sheepishly. “Maybe a little.”

Quiet footsteps approached. Saadiah gently joined them, her eyes kind, warm, and tender.

“Forgive me for interrupting,” she began softly. “Shei Er, dear—I realise tonight was difficult. But Hari Raya is about forgiveness, love, acceptance. You have our blessing. Whatever journey you walk—do it sincerely, do it honestly. If you ever need guidance, we’re here.”

Shei Er rose gently, eyes shimmering with emotion, hugging Saadiah respectfully, deeply grateful. “Thank you, Aunty. This means more to me than you can know.”

Saadiah held her softly, whispering gently, “We welcome you, my dear. Aidilfitri blessings to you, always.”

She left them quietly, and Aleem wrapped his arm gently around Shei Er’s shoulders, his voice warm and soft in the quiet night.

“See, Xue Er? Together, we’ll be alright.”

She nodded gently, leaning softly into his warmth, gazing up towards the clear stars scattered quietly above.

The night air felt lighter now, filled quietly with gentle hopes, honest intentions, and the promise of a future defined not by differences, but by courage, faith, and love.
