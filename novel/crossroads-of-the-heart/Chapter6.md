# **Chapter 6: Aidilfitri Blessings**

Yusuf’s family home buzzed warmly on the eve of Hari Raya. The gentle aroma of freshly-cooked rendang, lemang, and pineapple tarts filled the air. Yusuf stood beside Xin Yi at the entrance, her fingers nervously brushing against his palm. He offered her a reassuring smile.

“Don’t worry, Xin Yi. They’ll love you,” he whispered softly.

Her eyes flickered uncertainly, landing briefly on her right arm. Beneath the thin shawl she’d carefully draped over her shoulders, tattoos adorned her skin—beautiful artworks she loved, but now, symbols of potential worry.

Yusuf gently squeezed her hand. “Just be yourself.”

They stepped into the living room, and Yusuf’s mother, Kamilah, immediately looked up from arranging kuih neatly on a tray, her expression shifting between surprise and hesitant warmth. His father, Jamal, rose slowly from his seat, his welcoming smile tinged with curiosity.

“Yusuf, you’re early,” Jamal greeted warmly, his eyes subtly assessing the young woman standing anxiously beside his son. “This must be your friend.”

Yusuf stepped forward, his voice calm but proud. “Mak, Ayah, this is Xin Yi.”

Xin Yi smiled shyly, nodding respectfully. “Selamat petang, Uncle Jamal, Aunty Kamilah.”

His mother’s eyes softened slightly at her politeness, though subtle concern lingered, eyes lingering momentarily upon the shawl covering her arm.

“Welcome,” Kamilah said, gentle yet reserved. “Please, come in. Dinner’s nearly ready.”

Just then, Yusuf’s sister, Amira, swept into the room cheerfully, her husband Jun Yu closely behind her. Amira’s eyes sparkled knowingly upon seeing Xin Yi, quickly stepping forward to embrace her warmly.

“Welcome, welcome!” Amira said brightly. “Finally, we get to properly meet! Yusuf always mentions you.”

Yusuf shot his sister a grateful glance. Amira had been his confidante, reassuring him when doubt crept in, sharing her own experiences of marrying Jun Yu, a Chinese convert who now seamlessly belonged to their family.

Jun Yu offered a gentle smile and handshake, whispering quietly in Mandarin, “Don’t worry, we’ve all been through this.”

Dinner began pleasantly enough, yet a quiet, inevitable tension hovered delicately between polite conversations. Jamal engaged Yusuf in talk about work, while Amira and Jun Yu filled the silence with cheerful banter. But Kamilah’s eyes rarely left the shawl on Xin Yi’s arm, her gaze quietly anxious.

Finally, midway through the meal, Kamilah spoke softly, voice calm yet cautious. “Xin Yi, dear, I notice your shawl—is it just a fashion choice, or are you... covering something?”

Yusuf’s heart jumped, but before he could speak, Xin Yi answered gently yet courageously, removing the shawl slowly, revealing the elegant patterns inked clearly on her skin.

“Aunty, I have tattoos. They are part of who I am, reflections of my journey,” she admitted quietly, respectfully. “I realise they might concern you.”

Kamilah’s brows knitted briefly, exchanging a brief glance with Jamal. “I must admit, it surprises me,” she said softly, carefully choosing her words. “Have you considered how these tattoos align with Islam?”

Amira quietly intervened, voice gentle yet clear. “Mak, remember when Jun Yu first joined our family? People questioned him too. But Islam isn’t only about outward appearances. It’s about intentions, sincerity, and heart.”

Jun Yu nodded softly, offering quiet support. “I understand your concerns, Mak. But Amira guided me gently. Islam became my spiritual home, but I’m also proud of my Chinese roots. The same can be true for Xin Yi.”

Yusuf spoke up gently yet firmly, squeezing Xin Yi’s hand reassuringly beneath the table. “Mak, Ayah, I respect your concerns deeply. But I love Xin Yi precisely because she’s sincere, respectful, and brave. She’s embraced my world openly and wholeheartedly. She is genuinely learning and growing. Her tattoos don’t change the goodness I’ve always seen in her.”

Jamal sighed thoughtfully, carefully studying both Yusuf and Xin Yi, quietly reflecting on his own daughter’s marriage. “Your sister faced similar challenges, Yusuf. Perhaps we should trust your judgment.”

Kamilah remained quiet for a long moment before finally sighing softly, offering a gentle smile to Xin Yi. “My dear, forgive my caution. I only want Yusuf’s happiness. I worry, yes—but only because he is precious to me.”

Xin Yi’s eyes glistened softly, her voice trembling gently. “I understand, Aunty. Yusuf is precious to me too. I promise you—I’ll keep learning, keep respecting, and I’ll do my best to honour your family’s faith and traditions.”

Kamilah’s eyes softened further, visibly moved by the sincerity she heard. “That’s all I could ever ask.”

The tension eased quietly into warmth. Conversation flowed again, quieter but more comfortable. After dinner, as the family began their final Hari Raya preparations, Yusuf found Xin Yi quietly sitting outside on the porch, gazing thoughtfully at the moonlit sky.

“Are you okay?” he asked gently, sitting beside her.

She smiled softly, eyes bright yet reflective. “Your family is wonderful, Yusuf. It wasn’t easy—but it felt important.”

“They love you,” Yusuf whispered gently. “I knew they would.”

She chuckled softly, nudging his shoulder playfully. “You were nervous too, admit it.”

He laughed, smiling sheepishly. “Maybe a little.”

Quiet footsteps approached. Kamilah gently joined them, her eyes kind, warm, and tender.

“Forgive me for interrupting,” she began softly. “Xin Yi, dear—I realise tonight was difficult. But Hari Raya is about forgiveness, love, acceptance. You have our blessing. Whatever journey you walk—do it sincerely, do it honestly. If you ever need guidance, we’re here.”

Xin Yi rose gently, eyes shimmering with emotion, hugging Kamilah respectfully, deeply grateful. “Thank you, Aunty. This means more to me than you can know.”

Kamilah held her softly, whispering gently, “We welcome you, my dear. Aidilfitri blessings to you, always.”

She left them quietly, and Yusuf wrapped his arm gently around Xin Yi’s shoulders, his voice warm and soft in the quiet night.

“See, Xin Yi? Together, we’ll be alright.”

She nodded gently, leaning softly into his warmth, gazing up towards the clear stars scattered quietly above.

The night air felt lighter now, filled quietly with gentle hopes, honest intentions, and the promise of a future defined not by differences, but by courage, faith, and love.
