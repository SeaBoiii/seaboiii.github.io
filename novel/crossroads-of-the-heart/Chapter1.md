## **Chapter 1: Just Friends**

The elevator doors slid open with a soft ding, and Aleem found himself face-to-face with his reflection. He tugged nervously at his collar, wondering why tonight felt different, even though it was just dinner with Pei Ying and Shei Er—something they’d done countless times over the past three years. Yet every time he saw Shei Er, his heart fluttered, betraying his careful façade of friendship.

“Oi, Aleem! Daydreaming ah?” teased Pei Ying, walking towards him with a playful grin. Behind her stood Shei Er, smiling warmly, eyes twinkling mischievously.

“Aleem must be thinking of food again,” Shei Er laughed, nudging him lightly with her elbow.

“Maybe I’m hungry,” Aleem smiled sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck.

The trio turned to leave, just as the lift behind them chimed again, revealing their colleagues—Yuen Wah, Yong Sheng, and Xavier.

“Eh, look who we have here!” Yong Sheng exclaimed cheerfully. “You three also out for makan ah?”

“Join us lah,” Xavier interjected. “We were planning Tit Min’s farewell party anyway.”

Pei Ying’s eyes sparkled mischievously, pointing directly at Yuen Wah’s familiar blue-checkered shirt. “Weekend also wear office attire ah?”

Yuen Wah rolled his eyes, laughing along. “Comfort over style lah, please!”

As laughter filled the air, Aleem suddenly felt a gentle tug. Before he knew it, he was stumbling along, guided by Shei Er’s firm grip away from their colleagues.

“Eh, ditching us ah?” Yong Sheng’s teasing voice echoed behind them.

Aleem shrugged apologetically, barely suppressing a grin, as Shei Er led him towards the bustling hawker centre nearby. Her fingers remained intertwined with his, their warmth sending a pleasant shiver through him.

“Quiet today?” Aleem murmured, sneaking glances at her.

Shei Er offered a shy smile, eyes fixed on their joined hands. “Maybe just thinking.”

“About?”

She didn’t reply immediately. Instead, she impulsively raised his hand and gently kissed the back of it, surprising them both.

Aleem stopped walking, eyes wide. Shei Er froze, cheeks flushed deep red.

“Oh... sorry,” she stammered nervously. “It’s a habit—my mum always does that. I didn’t even realise—”

Aleem chuckled softly, sensing her embarrassment. “Friends don’t usually kiss hands, you know.”

She forced a laugh, trying to dismiss it. “Not like you’re going to marry me, anyway.”

Aleem’s voice turned serious, his eyes filled with sincerity. “I would marry you. If you said yes, I'd marry you without hesitation.”

Shei Er stared back, her heart pounding. Her lips parted, but no words came. The bustling hawker centre faded around them, leaving only their shared, uncertain silence.

“One step at a time?” Aleem finally suggested, gently squeezing her hand.

She nodded softly, repeating his words, her voice a whisper: “One step at a time.”
