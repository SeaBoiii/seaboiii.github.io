# **Chapter 15: Home, Between Us**

The first morning in their new home didn’t feel like fireworks.

It felt like sunlight on tile.

It felt like the quiet hum of a fridge that was too empty. A kettle that took too long to boil because no one had memorised the switch yet. Cardboard boxes stacked in one corner like unfinished thoughts.

It felt like—finally—breathing.

Shei Er stood barefoot in the living room, hair messy, sleeves rolled up. The house was small, practical, chosen not for aesthetics but for distance. A fresh start away from the noise of relatives and the constant sense of being watched.

Aleem walked in from the kitchen holding two mugs of Milo, the way he always did—like love was a daily routine, not a grand declaration.

He handed one to her.

She took it, their fingers brushing.

Something still fluttered in her chest at that simple contact, as if her body hadn’t fully accepted that she could have him like this, every day, without borrowing time from the world.

“You slept?” Aleem asked.

She nodded. “For the first time in weeks.”

Aleem leaned lightly against the wall, watching her with that quiet attentiveness that had always made her feel seen rather than examined.

He didn’t look like a man who had just survived a wedding drama. He looked like someone who was finally allowed to rest.

“You okay?” he asked again, softer.

Shei Er wrapped both hands around the mug, letting the warmth settle into her palms.

“I think I’m… learning what peace feels like,” she admitted.

Aleem smiled faintly. “Same.”

They stood there for a while, sipping slowly, listening to silence that wasn’t tense—just empty in the best way.

Then Shei Er’s gaze drifted toward the boxes.

Her heart tightened slightly.

Because peace wasn’t the absence of conflict.

It was the decision to keep building anyway.

---

The first Raya after their nikah came quietly.

No grand open house. No crowd of relatives. Just close family—Jamal and Saadiah, Amaliah and Jun Yu—and, surprisingly, Shei Er’s parents too.

It took months to arrange that invitation.

Months of gentle conversations with her mother that began with awkwardness and ended, slowly, with reluctant curiosity.

Her father had been quieter than her mother, but he was the first to accept the invitation.

“We should see where our daughter lives,” he had said simply.

Her mother’s expression had been complicated, but she nodded.

So now—on the first day of Hari Raya—Shei Er stood by the doorway of her new home, wearing a soft pastel baju kurung, her hijab pinned neatly, her tattoos covered but not hidden in shame. Covered because she wanted to, because today was tender, not because she was afraid.

Aleem stood beside her in baju Melayu, his songkok straight, his eyes calm.

She glanced at him.

He gave her the smallest nod.

*We’re doing this together.*

The doorbell rang.

Shei Er inhaled.

Aleem opened the door.

Her parents stood there with a bag of oranges and a box of pastries from a Chinese bakery—one of those quiet gestures that said *we are still us* even as we step into something unfamiliar.

Saadiah and Jamal arrived minutes later, bringing kuih and a container of rendang, Saadiah fussing lightly even as her eyes observed everything with care.

For a few minutes, the living room was a polite battlefield of manners.

Greetings. Smiles. The careful choreography of people who loved the same person but didn’t yet know how to love each other.

Then Jun Yu—bless his strategic heart—broke the stiffness by offering tea to Shei Er’s father in Mandarin.

“叔叔，喝茶。” *(Uncle, have some tea.)*

Her father blinked, then smiled.

“你会说中文？” *(You can speak Chinese?)*

Jun Yu chuckled. “一点点。I married into Malay family, so must learn everything. Same concept.”

Amaliah laughed loudly, the tension easing.

Shei Er’s mother’s shoulders loosened slightly.

And just like that, the room began to breathe.

Later, when everyone was seated, Saadiah stood and carried a tray of kuih to Shei Er’s mother personally.

“Aunty,” Saadiah said, voice gentle, “please eat. Today we celebrate together.”

Shei Er’s mother hesitated, then accepted the tray with both hands.

“Thank you,” she replied quietly.

Saadiah’s eyes flicked to Shei Er, then back to her mother.

“I know this was not easy,” Saadiah said. “But… we both raised our children the best we could. Now they are adults. They chose each other.”

Shei Er felt Aleem’s hand find hers under the table.

He squeezed once.

Her mother swallowed, eyes shiny.

“I was scared,” her mother admitted softly. “I thought I would lose her.”

Saadiah nodded. “I was scared too.”

That sentence—simple and honest—felt like a bridge being laid.

Shei Er’s father cleared his throat.

He looked at Aleem.

“Aleem,” he said, voice calm, “I will say this once. You are a good man. I can see you love her.”

Aleem’s posture straightened slightly.

“Yes, Uncle,” Aleem replied, respectful.

Her father nodded. “Then take care of her. But also… take care of us. Don’t let her forget her parents.”

Aleem didn’t hesitate.

“I won’t,” he said quietly. “I promise.”

Shei Er’s eyes stung.

Aleem wasn’t just marrying her.

He was marrying her world.

That evening, after everyone left, the house was full of leftovers and warmth.

Plastic containers lined the counter like trophies of a successful peace treaty.

Shei Er stood by the sink, washing dishes, sleeves rolled up again. Aleem stood beside her, drying, humming softly under his breath.

“What are you humming?” she asked.

Aleem shrugged. “Nothing. Just… my brain is happy.”

Shei Er snorted softly. “Your brain got playlist?”

“Of course,” he replied, dead serious. “Mostly logic. But today got romance track.”

She laughed, and the sound felt unfamiliar—light. Free.

Then, as she placed a plate on the rack, she grew quiet.

Aleem noticed immediately.

He always did.

“What’s wrong?” he asked gently.

Shei Er stared at her reflection in the kitchen window—her hijab, her face, her eyes that still looked like her, even after everything.

“I was thinking,” she admitted. “About who I used to be.”

Aleem leaned his hip against the counter, giving her space.

“And who are you now?” he asked.

Shei Er exhaled.

“I’m still me,” she said softly. “But… I’m also someone new. Someone who prays differently. Someone who loves differently. Someone who had to be brave.”

Aleem nodded slowly.

“You were always brave,” he said.

Shei Er shook her head. “No. I was careful. There’s a difference.”

Aleem stepped closer, drying towel forgotten in his hands.

“Careful is not weak,” he murmured. “Careful is how you survived.”

Shei Er turned to him.

“And you?” she asked. “You spent eight years alone. You could’ve stayed alone.”

Aleem’s smile faded into something honest.

“I almost did,” he admitted. “After my past… I thought maybe I was the problem. That love just wasn’t for me.”

Shei Er’s heart tightened.

She reached up and touched his cheek, thumb brushing lightly across the edge of his jaw.

“But you still chose me,” she whispered.

Aleem closed his eyes briefly, leaning into her touch.

“I chose you because you never felt like a gamble,” he said. “You felt like home I didn’t know I deserved.”

Shei Er blinked hard.

And then she laughed softly through the ache.

“You know what’s funny?” she murmured.

Aleem opened his eyes. “What?”

Shei Er stared at him, expression tender.

“You kept calling me Xue Er. Like you renamed me softly, just for you.”

Aleem’s lips curved.

“It’s your Chinese name,” he said, as if it was obvious.

“But no one calls me that,” she replied.

“I know,” he said gently. “That’s the point.”

Shei Er stared at him for a long moment.

Then she whispered, quieter than the house itself:

“Aleem… I think… I finally understand what you meant that night.”

He blinked. “Which night?”

“The night you said you’d marry me,” she replied softly. “I thought you were just… being romantic. But you were being certain.”

Aleem’s gaze softened.

“I was,” he said.

Shei Er nodded slowly.

“Then let me say something now,” she whispered.

Aleem’s brows lifted slightly. “Okay.”

Shei Er inhaled, then spoke with gentle clarity:

“I didn’t convert because I was forced. I didn’t stay because I was scared to leave. I stayed because I found something true. In the faith, yes… but also in you.”

Aleem’s throat bobbed.

She continued, voice steady now.

“And if anyone asks me one day—why I chose this life—I’ll tell them the truth.”

Aleem’s eyes searched hers.

“What truth?” he asked.

Shei Er smiled—small, real.

“That sometimes love crosses borders,” she said softly. “Sometimes it builds a home right between them.”

Aleem’s face broke into a smile that looked like relief, like gratitude, like eight years of loneliness finally unclenching.

He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her.

Shei Er leaned into him, forehead pressing into his shoulder.

For a moment, the world narrowed to a quiet kitchen, warm Milo, leftover kuih, and a man holding her like she was not fragile—but precious.

Outside, somewhere in the city, people would still gossip.

Some relatives would still be jealous.

Some would still not understand.

But inside this home, between these two people, there was something stronger than noise.

There was intention.

There was patience.

There was faith—quiet, lived, imperfect.

Shei Er lifted her head slightly and looked at him.

Aleem brushed a loose strand of hair back beneath her hijab carefully, reverently, as if everything about her was now sacred to him.

“One step at a time,” he whispered.

Shei Er smiled.

“No,” she corrected gently.

Aleem blinked. “Huh?”

Shei Er took his hands and intertwined their fingers, the way she had done on that first night when she couldn’t bear the teasing anymore and accidentally revealed her heart.

Then she said, with soft certainty—

“We’re already here.”

Aleem stared at her for a second, then laughed quietly, pulling her closer again.

And in that laughter, in that simple embrace, the story settled into its ending—not dramatic, not loud.

Just real.

Just home.
