# **Chapter 14: The Lines We Draw**

Morning came in soft slices of light through the hotel curtains—pale gold, quiet, almost gentle enough to make last night feel like a bad dream.

Almost.

Shei Er woke first. For a moment, she lay still, listening to Aleem’s breathing beside her. It was steady, calm—too calm, like his body had decided to protect him by pretending sleep was safe. His arm was draped across her waist, an instinctive hold that made her chest ache with something warm and protective.

She shifted slightly.

His grip tightened.

“Don’t go,” he mumbled, voice rough with sleep.

“I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered, smiling despite herself.

Aleem opened one eye and stared at her like he was checking if she was real. Then his expression softened—relief and tenderness layered together so tightly she could almost feel it.

“Good,” he said, and closed his eyes again, pulling her closer.

She should’ve felt comforted.

Instead, her mind drifted to Jun Yu’s warning.

*‘We’ll see how long she lasts.’*

Jealousy wasn’t just ugly—it was creative. It knew where to poke. It knew how to turn a wedding into a battlefield without ever raising a fist.

Shei Er stared at the ceiling and exhaled slowly, grounding herself.

Today wasn’t about romance.

Today was about boundaries.

---

At breakfast, Jun Yu and Amaliah arrived early, as promised—Jun Yu wearing a neutral expression that said he wasn’t here as family, he was here as security. Amaliah brought her usual energy, but Shei Er noticed how she scanned the room once before sitting down. It was subtle. Practiced.

They took a table near the corner.

Aleem sat with his back to the wall without thinking, like his body had remembered something ancient: protect what matters.

“You okay?” Amaliah asked, pouring tea for Shei Er.

Shei Er nodded. “Just… I didn’t think it would follow us into the next day.”

Amaliah’s lips pressed together. “Some people can’t stand a woman walking into a room with grace. They need to believe she stole something.”

Aleem’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t speak.

Jun Yu leaned forward, voice low. “Your mak saudara’s side—some of them have always been like that. They don’t hate you, Shei Er. They hate what you represent.”

Shei Er blinked. “What do I represent?”

Jun Yu shrugged slightly. “A mirror. That shows what they don’t have.”

Aleem’s eyes flicked to Shei Er’s hand—her ring—and he took her fingers gently, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles like he needed to remind himself she was here.

“You don’t need to fight them,” Aleem said quietly. “You just need to live. We’ll keep our circle small for now.”

Shei Er’s gaze dropped.

“Small circle,” she repeated softly, tasting the phrase.

It made sense. It also made her sad.

Because part of her had hoped marriage would mean *less* hiding, not more.

Amaliah seemed to read her thoughts. She reached across the table and squeezed Shei Er’s wrist gently.

“Small doesn’t mean lonely,” Amaliah said. “Small means safe. For now.”

Shei Er nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat.

Aleem spoke again, steady and certain. “After breakfast, we go straight home. You rest. I’ll message my parents—tell them to come over later. We talk properly. Clear the air.”

Jun Yu raised an eyebrow. “You sure your mak is ready?”

Aleem’s gaze hardened.

“She’ll be ready,” he said. “Because I’m not asking. I’m setting a line.”

---

Back at Aleem’s family home, the atmosphere shifted the moment Shei Er stepped inside.

Not hostility—just… weight.

Aunties in the living room glanced up too quickly, eyes lingering too long. Conversations softened like someone had turned the volume down.

Shei Er held her posture steady.

Aleem’s hand was on the small of her back, gentle pressure, a quiet reminder: *I’m here.*

They greeted the elders politely. Shei Er smiled. She did everything right.

Still, she felt like she was walking through a corridor of invisible judgement.

When she reached the kitchen, Saadiah was there, hands busy with kuih, her movements brisk—too brisk. Her lips curved into a smile that was warm… but slightly strained.

“You’re up early,” Saadiah said.

Shei Er nodded respectfully. “Yes, Aunty.”

Saadiah’s gaze flicked to Shei Er’s right arm—the tattoos hidden today under long sleeves, but Saadiah always seemed to remember them like they were still visible.

Then Saadiah said, softly, “How are you feeling?”

Shei Er hesitated. She could’ve said “fine.” She could’ve smiled and kept everything smooth.

Instead, she chose honesty.

“I’m okay,” she replied gently. “But… yesterday was a bit scary.”

Saadiah’s hands paused for just a second.

Then resumed.

“Yes,” Saadiah said, quieter now. “I heard.”

Shei Er watched her.

This woman wasn’t unkind. Shei Er could sense it. But she was also raised in a world where love came with rules, and rules were mistaken for safety.

“I didn’t expect jealousy,” Shei Er admitted. “Not on a day like that.”

Saadiah sighed. Her shoulders sagged slightly, as if the weight of motherhood had been waiting for an opening to show itself.

“Some people are… small-hearted,” Saadiah said. “And when they see someone beautiful enter the family, they panic.”

Shei Er blinked, surprised.

Saadiah turned to face her fully.

“You are beautiful,” Saadiah said, matter-of-factly, not like an auntie complimenting a niece, but like a woman acknowledging a truth. “And they think you will make their daughters look less. Or remind their sons of what they didn’t choose.”

Shei Er swallowed.

Saadiah’s voice softened. “But beauty is not the problem. Their insecurity is.”

A quiet stillness settled between them.

Then Saadiah reached for a tray and gestured to it. “Help me carry this out. We’ll serve the guests. And later… Aleem wants to talk.”

Shei Er nodded, relief loosening something tight in her chest.

“Okay, Aunty.”

---

Later, in the living room, Aleem sat with his father Jamal, Saadiah, Amaliah, Jun Yu, and Shei Er.

The room was calm. Too calm.

Aleem spoke first.

“Mak, Ayah,” he began, voice controlled, “yesterday, some things happened. I’m not going to pretend it didn’t.”

Jamal nodded slowly. “Say what you need to say.”

Aleem turned slightly, his hand finding Shei Er’s automatically. Their fingers interlaced.

“Xue Er is my wife now,” Aleem said. “Not my girlfriend. Not my colleague. Not the ‘Chinese girl.’ My wife.”

Saadiah’s expression tightened slightly at the term “wife,” as if the finality of it hit her again.

Aleem continued.

“I heard there were comments. Not just yesterday. Even before. About her tattoos. About her looks. About her race.”

Saadiah’s eyes lowered.

Aleem’s tone didn’t rise. But it sharpened.

“I will not allow anyone in this family to disrespect her,” he said. “Not behind her back. Not to her face. Not in jokes.”

He paused, letting the words sit.

“And if they can’t accept her,” he added, “then they don’t get access to us. Simple.”

The air shifted.

Amaliah exhaled softly, like she’d been waiting for him to say it.

Jamal’s eyes stayed on Aleem, steady. “That’s a strong line.”

Aleem nodded once. “It has to be.”

Then he looked at his mother.

“Mak… I love you,” he said quietly. “But I need you to be on my side. Fully. Not halfway.”

Saadiah’s eyes shimmered slightly.

She looked at Shei Er, then away.

For a moment, Shei Er saw it clearly—Saadiah’s fear. Not of Shei Er as a person, but of change. Of gossip. Of what family would say. Of losing control of the narrative.

Saadiah’s voice came out small.

“I’m trying,” she whispered.

Aleem’s gaze softened a fraction. “Then try louder.”

Silence.

Then Saadiah inhaled deeply and did something Shei Er didn’t expect.

She turned toward Amaliah.

“Go,” Saadiah said. “Call those aunties. Ask them to come.”

Amaliah blinked. “Mak—”

“Now,” Saadiah repeated.

Amaliah stood immediately and left the room.

Shei Er’s heart began to thump again.

Jun Yu leaned slightly toward Shei Er and murmured, “This is good. This is how it starts.”

---

Within minutes, two aunties and one older cousin’s wife entered the living room, expressions polite but guarded.

Saadiah stood.

Her back straightened, chin lifted.

She didn’t look like a gentle mother in that moment.

She looked like a woman who had carried a family on her back and decided she was done carrying other people’s poison.

“This is Nur Shei Er,” Saadiah said clearly. “Aleem’s wife.”

The women nodded, murmuring greetings.

Saadiah continued. “Yesterday, some of you spoke things that should not have been spoken.”

Their expressions shifted.

One auntie laughed awkwardly. “Aiyah, Saadiah… we just—”

“No,” Saadiah cut in, calm but firm. “No ‘just.’”

A hush fell.

Saadiah looked each of them in the eye. “She has embraced Islam. She married my son with sincerity. She respects us. So if you cannot respect her, then you do not enter my home.”

The aunties blinked, stunned.

One cousin’s wife muttered, “We didn’t mean—”

Saadiah raised her hand slightly. “You don’t need to mean it for it to hurt.”

She glanced toward Shei Er, and Shei Er felt her chest tighten.

Then Saadiah said words Shei Er would remember for the rest of her life:

“She is family now. If you shame her, you shame me.”

The room went quiet.

Jamal watched his wife with an unreadable expression—then nodded slowly, approving.

Aleem’s hand tightened around Shei Er’s, and she realised he was trembling a little. Not from fear.

From relief.

The aunties lowered their eyes, mumbled apologies, and left.

When the door closed, the house felt lighter.

Saadiah exhaled, long and deep, like she’d been holding her breath for years.

Then she turned to Shei Er.

“I’m sorry,” Saadiah said, voice softer now. “It should not have happened on your day.”

Shei Er swallowed hard.

“It’s okay,” she whispered.

Saadiah shook her head gently. “No. It’s not ‘okay.’ But… it will be better. I promise.”

Shei Er’s eyes warmed. She nodded slowly.

“Thank you, Aunty.”

Saadiah paused, then corrected her gently.

“You can call me Mak, if you want,” Saadiah said.

The word landed softly like a gift.

Shei Er’s throat tightened.

She looked at Aleem.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t push.

He only watched her with steady warmth, as if telling her—*choose when you’re ready.*

Shei Er breathed in slowly.

Then, quietly, she said it.

“Thank you… Mak.”

Saadiah’s eyes filled instantly, and she looked away quickly, pretending she needed to adjust the tray on the table.

But Shei Er saw the tremble in her hands.

Aleem leaned toward Shei Er and whispered, voice hoarse, “You just healed something in my mother.”

Shei Er blinked back tears.

“I didn’t do anything,” she whispered.

Aleem shook his head gently. “You stayed.”

---

That night, in their room, Aleem pulled Shei Er into his arms and held her tightly.

“We’re safe,” he murmured into her hair.

Shei Er closed her eyes.

Today had been heavy.

But it had also been a turning point.

Lines were drawn.

Not in anger.

In love.

She touched the ring on her finger, feeling its cool certainty.

“Aleem,” she whispered.

“Yes, Xue Er.”

She tilted her head up slightly. “If people keep trying… will you get tired?”

Aleem stared at her, expression steady.

“I waited eight years to love someone like this,” he said softly. “I’m not letting go because of noise.”

Shei Er’s chest loosened. She nodded slowly.

Then she rested her forehead against his.

“Okay,” she whispered. “Then let’s finish this story properly.”

Aleem’s lips curved into a small smile.

“Chapter fifteen,” he murmured, as if tasting the promise. “We’re almost there.”

Shei Er smiled too—soft, tired, real.

“One step at a time,” she whispered.

And in Aleem’s arms, she finally believed the words could hold.
