# **Chapter 14: The Lines We Draw**

Morning came in soft slices of light through the hotel curtains—pale gold, quiet, almost gentle enough to make last night feel like a bad dream.

Almost.

Xin Yi woke first. For a moment, she lay still, listening to Yusuf’s breathing beside her. It was steady, calm—too calm, like his body had decided to protect him by pretending sleep was safe. His arm was draped across her waist, an instinctive hold that made her chest ache with something warm and protective.

She shifted slightly.

His grip tightened.

“Don’t go,” he mumbled, voice rough with sleep.

“I’m not going anywhere,” she whispered, smiling despite herself.

Yusuf opened one eye and stared at her like he was checking if she was real. Then his expression softened—relief and tenderness layered together so tightly she could almost feel it.

“Good,” he said, and closed his eyes again, pulling her closer.

She should’ve felt comforted.

Instead, her mind drifted to Jun Yu’s warning.

*‘We’ll see how long she lasts.’*

Jealousy wasn’t just ugly—it was creative. It knew where to poke. It knew how to turn a wedding into a battlefield without ever raising a fist.

Xin Yi stared at the ceiling and exhaled slowly, grounding herself.

Today wasn’t about romance.

Today was about boundaries.

---

At breakfast, Jun Yu and Amira arrived early, as promised—Jun Yu wearing a neutral expression that said he wasn’t here as family, he was here as security. Amira brought her usual energy, but Xin Yi noticed how she scanned the room once before sitting down. It was subtle. Practiced.

They took a table near the corner.

Yusuf sat with his back to the wall without thinking, like his body had remembered something ancient: protect what matters.

“You okay?” Amira asked, pouring tea for Xin Yi.

Xin Yi nodded. “Just… I didn’t think it would follow us into the next day.”

Amira’s lips pressed together. “Some people can’t stand a woman walking into a room with grace. They need to believe she stole something.”

Yusuf’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t speak.

Jun Yu leaned forward, voice low. “Your mak saudara’s side—some of them have always been like that. They don’t hate you, Xin Yi. They hate what you represent.”

Xin Yi blinked. “What do I represent?”

Jun Yu shrugged slightly. “A mirror. That shows what they don’t have.”

Yusuf’s eyes flicked to Xin Yi’s hand—her ring—and he took her fingers gently, rubbing his thumb over her knuckles like he needed to remind himself she was here.

“You don’t need to fight them,” Yusuf said quietly. “You just need to live. We’ll keep our circle small for now.”

Xin Yi’s gaze dropped.

“Small circle,” she repeated softly, tasting the phrase.

It made sense. It also made her sad.

Because part of her had hoped marriage would mean *less* hiding, not more.

Amira seemed to read her thoughts. She reached across the table and squeezed Xin Yi’s wrist gently.

“Small doesn’t mean lonely,” Amira said. “Small means safe. For now.”

Xin Yi nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat.

Yusuf spoke again, steady and certain. “After breakfast, we go straight home. You rest. I’ll message my parents—tell them to come over later. We talk properly. Clear the air.”

Jun Yu raised an eyebrow. “You sure your mak is ready?”

Yusuf’s gaze hardened.

“She’ll be ready,” he said. “Because I’m not asking. I’m setting a line.”

---

Back at Yusuf’s family home, the atmosphere shifted the moment Xin Yi stepped inside.

Not hostility—just… weight.

Aunties in the living room glanced up too quickly, eyes lingering too long. Conversations softened like someone had turned the volume down.

Xin Yi held her posture steady.

Yusuf’s hand was on the small of her back, gentle pressure, a quiet reminder: *I’m here.*

They greeted the elders politely. Xin Yi smiled. She did everything right.

Still, she felt like she was walking through a corridor of invisible judgement.

When she reached the kitchen, Kamilah was there, hands busy with kuih, her movements brisk—too brisk. Her lips curved into a smile that was warm… but slightly strained.

“You’re up early,” Kamilah said.

Xin Yi nodded respectfully. “Yes, Aunty.”

Kamilah’s gaze flicked to Xin Yi’s right arm—the tattoos hidden today under long sleeves, but Kamilah always seemed to remember them like they were still visible.

Then Kamilah said, softly, “How are you feeling?”

Xin Yi hesitated. She could’ve said “fine.” She could’ve smiled and kept everything smooth.

Instead, she chose honesty.

“I’m okay,” she replied gently. “But… yesterday was a bit scary.”

Kamilah’s hands paused for just a second.

Then resumed.

“Yes,” Kamilah said, quieter now. “I heard.”

Xin Yi watched her.

This woman wasn’t unkind. Xin Yi could sense it. But she was also raised in a world where love came with rules, and rules were mistaken for safety.

“I didn’t expect jealousy,” Xin Yi admitted. “Not on a day like that.”

Kamilah sighed. Her shoulders sagged slightly, as if the weight of motherhood had been waiting for an opening to show itself.

“Some people are… small-hearted,” Kamilah said. “And when they see someone beautiful enter the family, they panic.”

Xin Yi blinked, surprised.

Kamilah turned to face her fully.

“You are beautiful,” Kamilah said, matter-of-factly, not like an auntie complimenting a niece, but like a woman acknowledging a truth. “And they think you will make their daughters look less. Or remind their sons of what they didn’t choose.”

Xin Yi swallowed.

Kamilah’s voice softened. “But beauty is not the problem. Their insecurity is.”

A quiet stillness settled between them.

Then Kamilah reached for a tray and gestured to it. “Help me carry this out. We’ll serve the guests. And later… Yusuf wants to talk.”

Xin Yi nodded, relief loosening something tight in her chest.

“Okay, Aunty.”

---

Later, in the living room, Yusuf sat with his father Jamal, Kamilah, Amira, Jun Yu, and Xin Yi.

The room was calm. Too calm.

Yusuf spoke first.

“Mak, Ayah,” he began, voice controlled, “yesterday, some things happened. I’m not going to pretend it didn’t.”

Jamal nodded slowly. “Say what you need to say.”

Yusuf turned slightly, his hand finding Xin Yi’s automatically. Their fingers interlaced.

“Xin Yi is my wife now,” Yusuf said. “Not my girlfriend. Not my colleague. Not the ‘Chinese girl.’ My wife.”

Kamilah’s expression tightened slightly at the term “wife,” as if the finality of it hit her again.

Yusuf continued.

“I heard there were comments. Not just yesterday. Even before. About her tattoos. About her looks. About her race.”

Kamilah’s eyes lowered.

Yusuf’s tone didn’t rise. But it sharpened.

“I will not allow anyone in this family to disrespect her,” he said. “Not behind her back. Not to her face. Not in jokes.”

He paused, letting the words sit.

“And if they can’t accept her,” he added, “then they don’t get access to us. Simple.”

The air shifted.

Amira exhaled softly, like she’d been waiting for him to say it.

Jamal’s eyes stayed on Yusuf, steady. “That’s a strong line.”

Yusuf nodded once. “It has to be.”

Then he looked at his mother.

“Mak… I love you,” he said quietly. “But I need you to be on my side. Fully. Not halfway.”

Kamilah’s eyes shimmered slightly.

She looked at Xin Yi, then away.

For a moment, Xin Yi saw it clearly—Kamilah’s fear. Not of Xin Yi as a person, but of change. Of gossip. Of what family would say. Of losing control of the narrative.

Kamilah’s voice came out small.

“I’m trying,” she whispered.

Yusuf’s gaze softened a fraction. “Then try louder.”

Silence.

Then Kamilah inhaled deeply and did something Xin Yi didn’t expect.

She turned toward Amira.

“Go,” Kamilah said. “Call those aunties. Ask them to come.”

Amira blinked. “Mak—”

“Now,” Kamilah repeated.

Amira stood immediately and left the room.

Xin Yi’s heart began to thump again.

Jun Yu leaned slightly toward Xin Yi and murmured, “This is good. This is how it starts.”

---

Within minutes, two aunties and one older cousin’s wife entered the living room, expressions polite but guarded.

Kamilah stood.

Her back straightened, chin lifted.

She didn’t look like a gentle mother in that moment.

She looked like a woman who had carried a family on her back and decided she was done carrying other people’s poison.

“This is Nur Xin Yi,” Kamilah said clearly. “Yusuf’s wife.”

The women nodded, murmuring greetings.

Kamilah continued. “Yesterday, some of you spoke things that should not have been spoken.”

Their expressions shifted.

One auntie laughed awkwardly. “Aiyah, Kamilah… we just—”

“No,” Kamilah cut in, calm but firm. “No ‘just.’”

A hush fell.

Kamilah looked each of them in the eye. “She has embraced Islam. She married my son with sincerity. She respects us. So if you cannot respect her, then you do not enter my home.”

The aunties blinked, stunned.

One cousin’s wife muttered, “We didn’t mean—”

Kamilah raised her hand slightly. “You don’t need to mean it for it to hurt.”

She glanced toward Xin Yi, and Xin Yi felt her chest tighten.

Then Kamilah said words Xin Yi would remember for the rest of her life:

“She is family now. If you shame her, you shame me.”

The room went quiet.

Jamal watched his wife with an unreadable expression—then nodded slowly, approving.

Yusuf’s hand tightened around Xin Yi’s, and she realised he was trembling a little. Not from fear.

From relief.

The aunties lowered their eyes, mumbled apologies, and left.

When the door closed, the house felt lighter.

Kamilah exhaled, long and deep, like she’d been holding her breath for years.

Then she turned to Xin Yi.

“I’m sorry,” Kamilah said, voice softer now. “It should not have happened on your day.”

Xin Yi swallowed hard.

“It’s okay,” she whispered.

Kamilah shook her head gently. “No. It’s not ‘okay.’ But… it will be better. I promise.”

Xin Yi’s eyes warmed. She nodded slowly.

“Thank you, Aunty.”

Kamilah paused, then corrected her gently.

“You can call me Mak, if you want,” Kamilah said.

The word landed softly like a gift.

Xin Yi’s throat tightened.

She looked at Yusuf.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t push.

He only watched her with steady warmth, as if telling her—*choose when you’re ready.*

Xin Yi breathed in slowly.

Then, quietly, she said it.

“Thank you… Mak.”

Kamilah’s eyes filled instantly, and she looked away quickly, pretending she needed to adjust the tray on the table.

But Xin Yi saw the tremble in her hands.

Yusuf leaned toward Xin Yi and whispered, voice hoarse, “You just healed something in my mother.”

Xin Yi blinked back tears.

“I didn’t do anything,” she whispered.

Yusuf shook his head gently. “You stayed.”

---

That night, in their room, Yusuf pulled Xin Yi into his arms and held her tightly.

“We’re safe,” he murmured into her hair.

Xin Yi closed her eyes.

Today had been heavy.

But it had also been a turning point.

Lines were drawn.

Not in anger.

In love.

She touched the ring on her finger, feeling its cool certainty.

“Yusuf,” she whispered.

“Yes, Xin Yi.”

She tilted her head up slightly. “If people keep trying… will you get tired?”

Yusuf stared at her, expression steady.

“I waited eight years to love someone like this,” he said softly. “I’m not letting go because of noise.”

Xin Yi’s chest loosened. She nodded slowly.

Then she rested her forehead against his.

“Okay,” she whispered. “Then let’s finish this story properly.”

Yusuf’s lips curved into a small smile.

“Chapter fifteen,” he murmured, as if tasting the promise. “We’re almost there.”

Xin Yi smiled too—soft, tired, real.

“One step at a time,” she whispered.

And in Yusuf’s arms, she finally believed the words could hold.
