# **Chapter 10: Officially Yours**

*(Shortly after the fateful dinner.)*

Something quietly shifted after that dinner—the night Aleem softly yet earnestly declared, “I would marry you.” Neither mentioned it explicitly, yet both felt a new tension, fragile and exciting, hovering delicately between friendship and something deeper.

In the days that followed, their conversations became softer, warmer, subtly different. Aleem’s gentle smiles lingered longer, and Shei Er caught herself staring when he wasn’t looking, heart racing nervously.

One afternoon, working quietly side by side in the office pantry, Aleem glanced over shyly.

“Xue Er, are you free this weekend?”

Her heart jumped slightly. “Yes, I’m free. Why?”

Aleem smiled gently, eyes warm with quiet courage. “Want to visit the aquarium with me? Just us.”

She paused softly, cheeks warming. It felt like a subtle but clear declaration: their first proper date, unspoken yet understood.

“Yes,” she replied softly, heart fluttering nervously. “I’d like that.”

At the aquarium that weekend, the soft glow of underwater lights bathed them gently, creating an intimate, dreamlike atmosphere. Surrounded by gentle waves of luminous blue, Aleem quietly slipped his hand into hers. She hesitated briefly, heart quickening, before squeezing his hand softly, accepting silently.

They wandered slowly, quietly marvelling at colourful fish drifting serenely behind glass. She smiled shyly as Aleem stopped at the jellyfish exhibit, mesmerized by their graceful drifting.

“They’re beautiful,” he murmured softly, eyes wide with childlike awe.

“You’re easily impressed,” she teased lightly, gently bumping shoulders.

He laughed quietly, squeezing her hand gently. “Maybe it’s not the jellyfish that impress me.”

She flushed softly, heart racing quietly, shyly meeting his eyes. For a moment, everything else faded away—the world reduced to their quiet breaths, gentle heartbeats, and soft, hopeful smiles.

“Aleem…” she whispered, suddenly serious. “About that night—when you said you’d marry me… did you mean it?”

He nodded slowly, sincerely, voice gentle yet firm. “Every word. But I’ll wait as long as you need.”

Her eyes softened gently, touched by his quiet sincerity, heart finally sure.

“You don’t have to wait anymore,” she whispered softly, voice trembling. “I’m ready now.”

His eyes widened gently, hope flickering cautiously. “You mean it?”

She smiled shyly, nodding. “Let’s make it official.”

Aleem’s smile widened beautifully, warm and bright. Gently, bravely, he raised her hand, pressing his lips softly against her knuckles—mirroring her impulsive gesture that fateful dinner.

“That’s supposed to be my move,” she laughed shyly, flushing brightly.

“Then consider it officially stolen,” he replied teasingly, eyes twinkling warmly.

They made it official that day beneath soft, shimmering aquarium lights. From that moment, everything felt quietly different. Aleem walked a little closer, their hands always quietly linked. At work, colleagues noticed quickly, teasing gently, happy their suspicions had finally proven true.

Janice playfully nudged Shei Er during a coffee break. “Finally! Took you two long enough.”

She blushed softly, smiling shyly. “I suppose good things take time.”

Weeks later, during another gentle stroll beneath twilight skies, Aleem whispered softly, “Do you remember that dinner night? The night you kissed my hand?”

She smiled shyly, nodding quietly. “Of course.”

“Do you know that was the exact moment I felt hope again?” Aleem admitted gently. “It gave me courage.”

She paused gently, eyes softening. “It changed things for me too. I realised something important.”

“What’s that?” Aleem asked softly.

She gently squeezed his hand, quietly sincere. “That love, real love, is worth every risk.”

He smiled warmly, deeply touched. “Then I’m grateful you took that risk.”

She chuckled softly, playfully nudging his shoulder again. “Me too.”

Days turned gently into months, quietly deepening their bond. Together, they navigated gently through the complexity of cultures, family conversations, and spiritual questions—each challenge drawing them closer, strengthening the quiet love between them.

One evening, curled quietly on a sofa at Aleem’s apartment, watching a movie neither paid attention to, she gently rested her head against his shoulder, smiling softly.

“Aleem,” she whispered softly, smiling gently up at him. “Have I ever told you how happy you make me?”

He smiled tenderly, kissing her forehead softly. “I think I have an idea.”

She laughed quietly, playfully hitting his chest lightly. “You’re ridiculous.”

“Ridiculously in love,” he replied gently, smiling softly. “With you, Xue Er.”

She flushed shyly, smiling brightly. “Me too, Aleem. Always.”

---

Their gentle, quiet love—born softly through friendship, patience, bravery, and sincerity—now blossomed beautifully, rooted firmly, deeply, carefully. Neither rushed nor hesitant, their hearts now sure, finally certain.

Because from that simple, impulsive kiss on his hand, beneath teasing laughter and warm streetlights, their hearts had quietly made a promise neither fully understood yet quietly trusted:

Together, step by gentle step, they would navigate every uncertainty, every challenge, every beautiful complexity ahead—forever guided softly by patience, respect, and quiet yet profoundly genuine love.
