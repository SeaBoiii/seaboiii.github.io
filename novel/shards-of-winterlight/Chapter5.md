The mirrored realm did not stay open.

It flickered out at dawn, like the last breath of a candle before wind. One moment, Sylra and Kaelen stood bathed in soft twilight; the next, they were ripped apart--each cast violently back into their own worlds.

But the connection lingered.

Sylra woke in her chambers, frost trailing along her walls in unfamiliar shapes. Spirals. Threads. Figures sketched in half-formed memory. Her hands trembled as she lit the sconces with a flick of her wrist. Light scattered across the frozen roses she'd carved long ago--and now, scattered among them, were snowflakes she did not remember shaping.

She whispered his name. Just once. It held no magic.

Kaelen, miles and dimensions away, blinked up at a colorless sky. The aurora had vanished. Yet he could still feel the shape of her fingers against his--cool, poised, trembling at the edges. He breathed into his palm, watched frost bloom outward like a memory trying to become real.

And he smiled.

The mirror opened again the next night.

Without words, they returned.

Not together--yet not apart. Like gravity redrawn, like stars learning new orbits.

Their second meeting was quieter. No introductions. No tests.

Kaelen brought a snowglobe.

He shook it in silence. Inside, a little glass forest flickered with enchanted snowfall.

"This is what my world remembers of magic," he said. "Toys. Trinkets. Pretty lies."

Sylra took it, cupping it carefully. "It's beautiful."

"It's lonely."

Their eyes met.

The nights passed like that. The mirrored realm opened with the moon and vanished with the dawn. Each time, they returned. Each time, they stayed longer. Sylra spoke of duty. Kaelen told stories he'd never shared aloud. They made snow dance between them with flicks of their fingers, building creatures of frost and memory.

Once, she laughed.

The frost bloomed across the floor in petal-shaped bursts. Kaelen froze, awe softening his usual mischief.

"You should laugh more," he said.

"It's dangerous," she replied, but her lips didn't deny it.

Every night, the realm deepened. The sky pulsed brighter. The boundaries thinner.

And so did the space between them.

What had begun as curiosity was becoming something neither dared name--but both felt in every shared breath, every lingering glance, every moment that ended too soon.

They were no longer just visitors in each other's world.

They were becoming part of it.
