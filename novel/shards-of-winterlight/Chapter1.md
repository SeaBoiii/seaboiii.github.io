The snow never truly stopped in Northreach. It drifted like breath held too long, suspended in air thick with memories. Sylra walked alone beneath spires of frost-laced stone, her footsteps softened by the hush of an eternal winter. The palace, sculpted from ice and shadow, stood silent around her--vast halls of crystalline arches and quiet rooms where no laughter echoed.

She didn't mind the silence. It was her companion, her shield, her kingdom.

Cloaked in a mantle of deep midnight-blue, lined with silver thread that shimmered faintly in the torchless corridors, Sylra passed beneath a vault of frozen roses--carvings made by her own hand in a moment of longing she would never confess. Her breath curled in the air, not because of cold--she was immune to that--but because something *else* stirred. A pulse, faint and unfamiliar, brushing against her consciousness like snowfall brushing bare skin.

She paused by the window of her northern watchtower. Beyond the panes of iceglass, the sky shimmered with twilight blues and ghostlight greens. The northern lights were early this year. She narrowed her eyes.

No... not just early. *Wrong.*

They flickered too quickly, too purposefully--like a signal, a whisper, a call.

Sylra pressed her fingertips to the frost. Ice blossomed from her touch in perfect spirals, but her attention was elsewhere. Her power had always been rooted in emotion, and now it trembled--not with fear, not with anger, but with something... *curious*. A tug in her chest. A question without words.

For the past six nights, she'd dreamed of unfamiliar skies. Of laughter not her own. Of a figure half-lost in mist, who looked at her as if she were not a queen, but a secret.

Dreams, she'd told herself. Echoes of loneliness.

But now the auroras danced like they remembered her. And the frost whispered.

She turned from the window.

"Prepare the Mirror Chamber," she told no one, yet the air obeyed.

Far below, the ancient gears began to turn.
