The world Kaelen knew was always in motion.

Snowflakes spun around him like stray thoughts, too fleeting to hold, too many to count. He glided barefoot across the iced-over surface of a mountain lake, his staff trailing behind him with a casual drag that carved fractal frost patterns into the glimmering surface. The wind hummed his name--or perhaps it only felt that way. After all, no one else remembered it.

He leapt from the lake's edge onto a drift, landing with weightless ease. The wind obeyed him, as it always did, like a loyal creature made of breath and mischief. Yet even in all its playfulness, the sky today felt… strange. He stilled.

Overhead, the clouds parted.

A ribbon of color sliced the heavens--an aurora, too early for this season, too vivid for this world. It shimmered in hues he didn't have names for, and in its wake, the air grew still--not calm, but watchful.

Kaelen tilted his head.

A whisper--not a sound, but a sensation--brushed the edges of his mind. Cold, not from the air, but from something distant and echoing. A presence. Something not of *here*.

He spun his staff once, grounding himself in movement, but the whisper lingered. Faint as frost on a mirror. He frowned, uncertain for the first time in decades.

As the wind circled him again, he looked toward the peaks beyond, where the aurora now curved like a beckoning hand. It wasn't just light. It was a door. A tear in the fabric of what he knew.

A smile ghosted across his lips, sharp and curious.

"Is someone calling me?" he murmured.

The storm answered.

And Kaelen, spirit of frost and forgotten laughter, ran into the wind to find out who had remembered his name.
