On the seventh night, the mirror realm trembled.

It began with a flicker in the sky--a brief, stuttering pulse in the aurora's ribbon. When Sylra stepped into the mirrored world, she felt it instantly: a wrongness in the air, like pressure building beneath porcelain.

Kaelen arrived moments later, skidding to a halt just before her with his usual crooked grin. "Miss me?"

She did. But something in the realm groaned. The sky rippled.

Sylra raised a hand. The frost beneath their feet answered sluggishly, as if growing weary. "It's weakening."

Kaelen frowned, spinning his staff idly. "Maybe it's just the weather between worlds."

"Or maybe we were never meant to stay this long."

They stood in silence, listening. Somewhere, the mirrored realm cracked--not visibly, but subtly, in its rhythm. The echo of their steps no longer mirrored perfectly. The light dimmed at odd angles.

That night, they didn't conjure snow-creatures or share stories. They spoke of *magic.*

Sylra summoned a sphere of frost between her palms. "My power is rooted in control. I was taught that emotions make ice wild. Dangerous."

Kaelen chuckled. "Then I'd be the patron saint of magical disasters."

"I'm serious. I once froze an entire valley because I panicked."

He stepped closer. His voice softened. "What were you afraid of?"

She looked up, eyes reflecting too many memories. "Being seen."

Kaelen didn't laugh. He only nodded.

Then, gently: "My magic disappears when people stop believing in me. I used to fight for attention. Now I wonder if fading is... quieter."

She touched his hand. "You're not fading now."

And for a moment, the realm stilled. Whole. Holding them.

But it didn't last.

A sound like glass under strain filled the sky. The aurora above spasmed.

The mirror realm was breaking.

They barely made it back before the rift slammed shut behind them. In Sylra's world, the palace windows cracked. In Kaelen's, the wind howled in protest.

The rules were simple:
- *You belong to your world.*
- *You must not stay too long.*

But neither of them were ready to obey.

Not when the only place they had ever truly been understood… was in each other's arms.
