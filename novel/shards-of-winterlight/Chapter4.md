Neither of them moved.

The mirror realm around them was suspended in a kind of dream--a twilight expanse of crystalline ground and sky with no clear beginning or end. The aurora above twisted like a living thing, its ribbons of color bathing the space in hues neither had ever seen before.

Sylra studied him like she might study a storm: warily, reverently, searching for signs of danger or beauty. His smile didn't falter. Kaelen stepped forward, boots skimming the frost-laced floor without sound, as if gravity hadn't quite remembered how to hold him.

"I didn't mean to intrude," he said, voice gentle. "I was... drawn."

"By the light?"

He shook his head. "By something colder. Sharper. Quieter."

Sylra's breath caught. She had heard the same call--felt it behind her ribs like a second heartbeat. A voice made not of sound, but of knowing. She looked down at the pool of ice between them, now turned completely still. Her reflection shimmered beside his.

"What is this place?" he asked, curiosity winning over caution.

"A mirror between realms. It only opens during the Frost Alignment, once every hundred years. I found the spell in the Winter Codex." Her gaze lingered on him. "But you… you're not from my world."

He nodded. "I guard a realm where belief fuels magic. But belief is fading. I'm... not often seen."

Sylra tilted her head. "Then how are you here?"

Kaelen took another step. Their reflections merged, just for a moment.

"Because you believed in me before we met."

A silence fell between them--thick, electric, tender.

Sylra reached forward slowly, as though through water. Her fingers brushed his.

The frost beneath them lit up in silver-blue veins, not cracking, not breaking--but awakening.

Kaelen didn't pull away.

Neither did she.

And for the first time in her life, the ice responded not with fear or warning--but with warmth.

They stood there, hand to hand, in the glow of an impossible sky, two winter-forged souls tethered by something neither fully understood.

But both were willing to follow it.

Wherever it led.
