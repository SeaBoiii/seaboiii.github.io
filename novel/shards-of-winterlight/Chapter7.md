On the eighth night, she did not let go.

The mirror realm shivered around them, the aurora fluttering like a startled bird. Time there had always been a held breath, but tonight the breath snagged. Sylra felt the strain under her skin the way one feels thunder long before it breaks. The frost at their feet was too bright, too precise--every vein of light sharply etched as if the world were bracing.

"Just one more moment," she whispered, fingers still laced with Kaelen's.

"Moments are greedy," he said, trying for lightness, failing to hide the worry flickering at the edges of his smile. "They always want another."

She closed her eyes and anchored to the warmth hidden inside the cold: his hand, steady and sure; his breath a soft halo; the way the air settled when he looked at her as if she were not a crown, but a person. She let love--not fear--guide the shape of her magic. The frost didn't spike this time. It folded into quiet hexagons, settling like a snowfall that had learned patience.

Dawn knifed the seam. The mirror realm lurched.

The rift tore them apart.

Sylra stumbled into her watchtower as the world slammed back. The palace boomed with a deep, hollow note, and a hairline fracture split across the highest window like a pale lightning scar. In the courtyards, fountains froze mid-arc, each stream captured at a slant as if surprised by its own beauty. She steadied herself against an ice-pillar and breathed in measured counts until the tremor in her hands subsided.

Somewhere below, stewards would awaken to the sudden hush of halted water and creak of settling walls. She whispered a smoothing charm that gentled the noises, an emperor's hand stroking a restless hound. The fracture held--but it did not heal.

*Too long,* the Winter Codex warned from memory. *A heart held at the seam thins the shell of its own sky.*

She pressed her palm to the cracked window. The cold accepted her, not as a command but as a confidant. "I know," she said to the frost. "I know."

Far across an unseen gulf, Kaelen skated the spine of a gale.

He chased the seam as it closed, riding its afterglow, tracing the taste of her through a corridor of thinning light. He should not have tried; every instinct in him--reckless, laughing--told him to anyway. The aurora dwindled to a filament. He bent around it like a river around a stone and slipped his hand through what remained of the rift.

For a heartbeat, he was in her sky.

Not wholly--no, not safely. He was a smudge of breath on cold glass, a suggestion more than a body. The world there felt denser, truer in its gravity, and it pulled at him with a tenderness that was also a warning. Below, a palace of spears and roses lifted into the morning. A lone figure stood at a high window, her hand on the fracture, head bowed in the frankness of private thought.

"Sylra," he said, though sound did not carry across the skin of worlds. Frost answered for him, a fine scintillation across the glass, as if his name had learned to write in light.

The rift snapped closed. He reeled back, both hands gripping his staff now, fingers gone briefly translucent. The world around him was suddenly too loud--the skirl of the wind, the skitter of ice on a tundra stone, the far-off laugh of a child that did not belong to him.

He landed on a blue-veined wall of glacier and stood very still.

Memory was a brittle thing. He had lost names to time before; he had lost faces, voices, the exact weight of a laugh. Not this time. Not *hers.*

Kaelen lifted his staff. He touched the glacier with its crook, and frost rose obediently, blooming into relief: the tilt of a mouth he'd only just learned, the clarity of a gaze that steadied storms, the line of a neck like a note held perfectly true. He did not embellish. He carved only what he knew, as precise as prayer. When the image looked back at him with the first suggestion of recognition, something inside him unclenched.

"If the world forgets," he told the ice, "you will remember for it."

He pressed his palm to the carving and left there a simple sigil--two interlocking spirals, one tighter, one looser, like snow and wind. His mark; their meeting.

The carving did not speak. But the glacier kept it, and that was enough.

That night, the mirror opened with a stutter, as if catching itself mid-fall. Kaelen arrived first, pacing a narrow figure-eight into the frost until her footfalls stilled him. Sylra stepped through the seam with a steadiness that belied the exhaustion in her bones.

"You crossed," she said quietly, not as accusation, not as praise.

He winced. "Only a fingertip of a moment. I just--" He worked his hands open and closed as if testing whether the light still held him. "I needed to see the world that holds you."

"And?"

"And it was heavier than mine," he said, the wonder simple and sincere. "It felt… honest." He glanced up, contrition and defiance sharing the same boyish line of his mouth. "Also, I think your sky tried to keep me."

"Of course it did," she said, and almost smiled. Then the almost faltered. "The palace cracked."

He sobered. "Because you stayed?"

"Because we both did." She turned her palm upward, showing him the faintest tremor--a confession more intimate than words. "My control is built of walls. You… you make me want to open them. The realm notices."

Kaelen stepped close enough that his breath ghosted hers. "Maybe the walls are the problem, not the opening."

"You don't understand what happens when my magic slips," she said, voice low. "The first time I panicked, I froze a valley and didn't thaw it for a month."

"I understand this," he said, and reached for her hand. "You held on this morning, didn't you? And the frost listened. Not like a chain. Like a conversation."

She thought of the hexagons settling in patience, of the way the ice had calmed when she named love without fear. She let the thought breathe.

The seam hummed uneasily. They both felt it.

"We need a rule," Sylra said at last, the queen returning to her voice. "No crossing. Not again. Not until we understand the cost."

He nodded, chastened but grateful that the rule still included *we.*

"And another," she added, softer. "If the mirror falters… we don't force it. We wait."

"Even if waiting hurts," he said.

"Especially then."

The realm steadied, barely. They stood in that narrow mercy while the aurora penned delicate shapes along the sky--letters in a script only the heart could read.

Kaelen cleared his throat, sudden boyish. "I made you something. Well. I made a *you*. On a glacier. It's not very courtly, but it is--" He gestured helplessly. "True."

Sylra's cheeks colored like frost kissed by dawn. "You carved me into the world."

"I carved you out of forgetting."

For a long moment, nothing moved but light. Then she reached beneath her cloak and drew out a length of narrow ribbon, the kind she used to bind the Winter Codex when its pages shook in stormlight. She spoke a word and the ribbon glinted--threaded now with the faintest green of aurora.

"Then let us both remember," she said, tying it around his wrist. The ribbon sat there like a quiet oath, cool as a promise, warm as a touch. "So that when we obey our rules, we do not mistake prudence for absence."

He looked at it with a care that softened every line of him. "Frostbound," he murmured.

"Frostbound," she agreed.

They did not kiss. The realm itself seemed to hold its breath in relief. They only stood there, hands entwined, while the aurora wrote its patient sentences overhead and the mirror, for this night at least, held.

When dawn came, they let go--deliberately, gently, like closing a book between chapters, both of them already reaching for the place where their thumbs would keep the page.
