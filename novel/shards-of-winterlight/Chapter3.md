In the deepest hour of twilight, when neither world owned the sky, the veil opened.

It began with a shimmer in the north, a breath drawn in slow silver. Sylra stood at the heart of the Mirror Chamber, her bare hands outstretched above a pool of ice so smooth it reflected stars from both memory and imagination. The chamber, carved from living frost, pulsed with quiet magic--the kind that remembered how to listen.

She exhaled slowly. Magic laced her breath, turned it into mist, into meaning.

Above her, the mirrored dome responded. A spiral of frost bloomed outward, and within its heart, the air began to fracture. Not violently, but delicately--like snowflakes deciding not to fall, but to hover instead. The aurora surged. A seam split the sky.

And somewhere far away, Kaelen stepped into the same moment.

He felt it before he saw it--a rift tearing open midair like a page from a forgotten story. A slash of light, too pale to be sun and too alive to be moon. He didn't hesitate. Staff in hand, laughter in his chest, he raced toward the opening.

The veil rippled.

One step through.

Two worlds collapsed inward.

For a breathless instant, everything was silence--and then, **she** was there.

Sylra turned.

A boy stood at the edge of her mirror pool, dressed in frost-laced clothes, wild white hair tumbling into eyes the color of frozen rivers. He looked young and ancient all at once, as though he belonged more to weather than to years.

Kaelen blinked. The air smelled different here--like pine, like memory. And before him, wreathed in stillness, was a woman sculpted in moonlight and snow. Regal. Alone. Eyes like glaciers that held warmth behind walls.

Neither spoke.

Time didn't move.

Then Kaelen tilted his head and grinned.

"So," he said, voice light as falling snow, "you're real."

Sylra's fingers twitched at her side. The mirror pool stilled.

"And you're late," she replied.

And the frost between them smiled.
