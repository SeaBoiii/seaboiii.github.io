# Chapter 10 -- Quiet Reconciliation

Reconciliation, for them, did not look like flowers at a doorstep.

It did not look like long paragraphs sent at midnight.

It looked like small adjustments that told the truth without needing to say it.

After the dinner, Aleem did not over-message.

He didn't try to "make up for it" with intensity.

He simply became more careful.

On Tuesday, when he realised work might run long, he texted Kira before the meeting even started.

**Aleem:** *Heads up: my day might stretch. I'll update you properly later. No need to wait for replies.*

Kira read it once, then set her phone down.

She felt something ease.

Not because she demanded control.

Because she respected consideration.

She replied after she finished her own work.

**Kira:** *Thank you for telling me early.*

A simple sentence.

But it carried weight.

It meant: *I see the effort.*

It meant: *I trust repair.*

---

The next weekend, Kira invited Aleem over.

Not to her house.

To Farah's.

Farah had offered her kitchen with the casual generosity of someone who believed affection should be useful.

"Come over," Farah had said on the phone, as if planning a meal was the same as planning a chat. "I have groceries. I have space. I have opinions."

Kira had laughed. "We're not having a summit meeting."

"Sure," Farah replied. "Then why are you involving my kitchen?"

Because Kira wanted something neutral.

A room that didn't belong to either of them.

A space where she didn't have to curate intimacy.

Farah's house was already full of it.

When Kira arrived, Wen was already there, sitting at the counter with a mug of tea, colour returned to her cheeks. Aisyah was on the sofa, scrolling through her phone with the intensity of someone monitoring the world. Yuxin was cutting strawberries into perfect slices for no reason other than that she liked symmetry.

Farah stood in the kitchen like a general.

"You're early," she told Kira.

"Habit," Kira said.

Farah pointed a knife at her. "Good. Start washing the vegetables."

Kira did.

She tied her hair back. She rolled up her sleeves. She let herself settle.

When the doorbell rang, it wasn't dramatic.

It was just… a sound.

Kira dried her hands on a towel.

Farah called out, "I'm not opening it. I'm busy being hospitable."

Kira walked to the door and opened it.

Aleem stood there with a paper bag in one hand.

Not flowers.

Not gifts.

Ingredients.

"I brought mushrooms," he said.

Kira stared.

He continued, as if explaining something obvious. "Farah said you're cooking. I didn't want to show up empty."

Kira's mouth curved.

"Come in," she said.

Aleem stepped inside, pausing automatically to take off his shoes without being told. He greeted the girls with polite warmth.

"Hi," he said.

Aisyah's eyes narrowed slightly, protective by nature, but her tone was civil. "Hi."

Yuxin smiled brightly. "You brought mushrooms. That's adorable."

Aleem blinked, uncertain whether he was being teased.

Farah leaned into the doorway, arms crossed.

"Mushrooms are fine," she declared. "But if you ruin my kitchen, I will ruin your reputation."

Aleem nodded solemnly. "Understood."

Wen lifted her mug slightly in greeting, calm as always.

Aleem returned the nod.

Kira watched the exchange and felt a quiet relief.

No one was competing.

No one was performing.

This wasn't a trial.

It was simply life expanding.

---

They cooked in a loose rhythm.

Farah gave instructions like she enjoyed being obeyed.

Yuxin hovered near the stove, offering commentary and aesthetics.

Aisyah watched Aleem with the casual vigilance of someone who loved Kira fiercely.

Wen remained at the counter, occasionally offering a quiet suggestion that somehow improved everything.

Aleem moved through the kitchen carefully.

Not stiff.

Just respectful.

He asked before opening drawers.

He washed his hands without being told.

He listened.

Kira stood beside him at the cutting board, slicing mushrooms into thin pieces.

Aleem chopped garlic with slow precision.

Their shoulders brushed once.

Neither of them reacted.

The brush felt normal.

Like their bodies were learning the shape of each other without urgency.

Farah watched them, unimpressed by romance but attentive to sincerity.

"So," Farah said, wiping her hands on a towel. "Tell me your intentions."

Kira froze.

Aleem paused mid-chop.

Yuxin made a sound like she was trying not to laugh.

Aisyah's eyebrows rose.

Wen's expression didn't change.

Kira's voice came dry. "Farah."

Farah lifted a hand. "I'm not being dramatic. I'm being efficient."

Aleem set the knife down carefully.

He didn't look offended.

He didn't look defensive.

He looked… thoughtful.

"I like Kira," he said.

Simple.

Then he added, still calm, "And I don't want to take her away from anyone."

Kira's chest tightened.

Aisyah's gaze softened almost imperceptibly.

Farah studied him as if weighing the sentence.

Aleem continued, voice steady.

"I want to be someone who fits into her life, not someone who demands it."

Silence.

Then Farah nodded once, satisfied.

"Okay," she said. "Carry on chopping."

Yuxin laughed.

Aisyah shook her head, amused despite herself.

Kira exhaled, the tension leaving her shoulders in one slow release.

Aleem picked up the knife again without making the moment bigger than it needed to be.

And somehow, that was what made it intimate.

Not the declaration.

The restraint.

---

Later, when the food was almost done and the kitchen had quieted into the soft hum of simmering, Farah stepped out to take a call. Yuxin disappeared to set the table with unnecessary elegance. Aisyah went to check on something in the living room.

For a brief moment, it was just Kira and Aleem.

The stove light warmed their hands.

The scent of garlic lingered in the air.

Kira leaned lightly against the counter.

Aleem stood beside her, drying a dish with a towel.

He didn't speak immediately.

Neither did she.

Silence settled.

Not as absence.

As comfort.

Kira's shoulders eased, then--without thinking--she rested her head gently against Aleem's shoulder.

It was not dramatic.

It was instinct.

Her hair brushed his shirt.

Aleem stilled.

Not startled.

Careful.

He didn't lift his arm to hold her right away.

He waited--one breath, two--giving her space to change her mind.

Kira didn't move away.

So Aleem lowered his arm slowly, resting his hand lightly at her upper back.

Not pulling.

Just placing.

Kira closed her eyes.

Her body didn't feel like it was surrendering.

It felt like it was resting.

Aleem's voice was quiet.

"I'm sorry again," he said.

Kira didn't lift her head.

"I know," she murmured.

Then, after a pause, she added, "I'm glad you didn't panic."

Aleem's breath left him in a soft laugh.

"I wanted to," he admitted.

Kira's lips curved against his shoulder.

"But you didn't," she said.

"No," Aleem replied. "I didn't want to make it about my discomfort."

Kira's chest tightened at that.

How rare it was--someone who could sit with the fact that they had disappointed you without turning it into a plea for reassurance.

Kira lifted her head slightly, just enough to look at him.

Aleem met her gaze.

Steady.

Present.

Kira's fingers, resting against his forearm, curled lightly.

Aleem's hand stayed warm at her back.

Neither of them reached for a kiss.

They didn't need to.

This was intimacy too.

This was a kind of closeness built from patience.

> 爱不是证明。
>
> 爱是日常。
>
> Love is not proof.
>
> Love is the everyday.

The sound of Yuxin returning broke the moment gently.

"Okay!" she announced. "If you two are done being quietly wholesome, dinner is ready."

Kira laughed, stepping away.

Aleem's hand dropped naturally.

No clinging.

No regret.

Just a shared glance that said: *We're okay.*

When they sat down to eat, the table was full.

Not just with food.

With people.

With laughter.

With the kind of love that had existed long before either of them had chosen romance.
