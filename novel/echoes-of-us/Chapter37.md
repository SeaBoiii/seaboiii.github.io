## Chapter 37: The Space Between Words

The message came in on a Friday night, quiet and unassuming.

> *Hi Hana. Hope you’re okay with random messages. Just need a neutral ear tonight.*

It was from Crystal.

Of all people, Crystal.

Hana sat up in bed, thumb hovering over the keyboard. Then smiled softly and replied:

> *Always okay. Want to call or just text?*

> *Text, if that’s okay. My brain’s too fast and my mouth can’t catch up.*

---

They didn’t talk about big things at first.

Just work.

Clients. Deadlines. Sleep debt. Small annoyances that stack like receipts you never asked for.

But slowly, Crystal's tone shifted.

> *It’s weird. Everyone thinks I’ve got it figured out. That I’m thriving. But lately, I’m not even sure if I like the version of me they admire.*

Hana didn’t rush in with comfort.  
She just let the message breathe.

Then replied:

> *Is it that you don’t like her? Or you’re just tired of being her all the time?*

A pause.

Then:

> *Maybe the second one.*

> *It’s like I’ve become the Crystal everyone *needs*, and I forgot how to be the one I *miss.**

---

Hana let out a quiet breath. Then typed:

> *I think we all carry versions of ourselves that help the world run smoother.*  
> *But the one you miss? She deserves space too. Even if she’s quieter. Even if she doesn’t close every deal.*  
> *You don’t have to earn rest by being irreplaceable.*

No reply for ten minutes.

Then:

> *Can I be honest? I didn’t think I could talk to you like this.*

> *Not because I didn’t trust you. But because… you’re Aleem’s person. I thought maybe you wouldn’t want to get too close.*

Hana smiled.

> *Being Aleem’s person doesn’t make me anyone else’s stranger.*  
> *I see you, Crystal. Not as Aleem’s friend. Just as you.*

They talked for another hour.

About pressure. About identity. About what it means to build a life that doesn’t always fit the version people expect from you.

Crystal didn’t ask for answers.

Hana didn’t give any.

They just *held space*, together.

---

Before they signed off, Crystal sent one last message:

> *Thank you for being the kind of person who sees through the strong parts and still stays.*

Hana replied:

> *Thank you for letting me in.*

---

The next morning, Crystal added Hana to a private Telegram chat.

Just the two of them. No label. No explanation.

Only the title:  
**“Breathers.”**
