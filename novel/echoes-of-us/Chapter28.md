## Chapter 28: The Weight of Different Paces

Crystal didn’t slow down.

Three months into her role at the tech firm, she was already in charge of a regional project — Southeast Asia territory review, potential for expansion. Her manager called it “leadership prep.” Crystal saw it for what it was: a test. One she planned to ace.

But then came the announcement: a two-month overseas secondment. Not a permanent posting — just enough time to *shake the balance she’d been carefully maintaining.*

Jakarta. Mid-June to August.  
Six weeks away from everything familiar.  
Six weeks away from *him.*

They sat at his shop, lights dim, fan humming overhead.

“I didn’t volunteer,” she said. “But I couldn’t say no either.”

He nodded. Said nothing at first.

Then, calmly: “I figured something like this would come eventually.”

She blinked. “You don’t sound surprised.”

“I’m not,” he said. “But I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t affect me.”

She exhaled. “I don’t want you to feel like I’m choosing work over you.”

“I don’t,” he said. “But I know how much this matters to you. And I won’t be the reason you hold back.”

They didn’t argue.

But Crystal still went home heavy.

Her life was accelerating. And sometimes she feared that love — even the strong kind — didn’t always keep up.

A week later, ABIX planned a casual dinner.

Nothing fancy — Korean BBQ, Crystal’s idea.

She invited him. No pressure.

He showed up right on time, toolbox still slung over one shoulder from a last-minute job.

Ivan raised a brow. “Still working?”

“Minor emergency fix,” he said. “Didn’t want to bail.”

Aleem grinned. “Dedication. I like it.”

He didn’t say much over dinner — just helped grill, passed out drinks, laughed when Aleem made dry remarks about “tech life vs. real life.”

When Crystal leaned back after the third refill of barley tea, Isabelle whispered beside her, “He blends well.”

Crystal didn’t smile big. Just soft.

“He always does.”

On the way home, walking side by side through the humid night, she asked him quietly:

“Do you think we’ll be okay, with me away for six weeks?”

He looked at her like it was obvious.

“You’re not leaving me behind, Crystal. You’re just *flying a bit further.* I’ll be here when you land.”

She swallowed, chest warm.

“Still want to be part of this world? My people? My pace?”

He reached out, fingers gently brushing hers.

“I already am.”

That night, she wrote in her notes app:

> *Some people show up loud, hoping to be seen.*  
> *He shows up quiet, ready to stay.*  
> *And when I move, he doesn’t chase or ask me to wait.*  
> *He just walks with me — in his own rhythm.*  
> *And somehow, that’s enough.*
