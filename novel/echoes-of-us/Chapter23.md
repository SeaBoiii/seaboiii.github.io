## Chapter 23: The Edge of Certainty

Ivan stood at the platform, watching the train pull in.

It was just a job interview — another technical opening at a rail operations firm. Something in his comfort zone. Something that made sense.

But that wasn’t where he was going today.

He stepped onto the opposite train.

---

A week ago, his girlfriend had passed him a flyer from her office pantry bulletin board. A startup in urban mobility — electric scooters, dynamic transit maps, integrating AI for city logistics.

He’d scoffed at first. “This is chaos.”

She had shrugged. “Maybe chaos is what you need.”

He didn’t bring it up again.  
But he kept the flyer.

And now, somehow, he was headed for their office.

Not because he wanted to leave his path — but because something in him had started to itch. The need to stretch, even if just slightly.

---

The office was messy. Open-plan. Someone had brought their dog. Whiteboards covered in post-its and algorithms. He hated it.

And weirdly, *he didn’t want to leave*.

The CTO — a young guy in a hoodie — greeted him with a fist bump instead of a handshake.

“You’re from rail ops, right? We’ve never had someone from your side. But that’s what excites me.”

Ivan blinked. “Excites you?”

“Yeah. Stability and structure. You’re probably great at systems. We’re great at ideas. You could be the glue.”

Ivan paused.

For years, he had been the guy who *fit into systems*. Who understood them. Who worked quietly in the background making sure things *didn’t break*.

But the thought of *building a system from scratch*?

That was terrifying.

And thrilling.

---

He didn’t accept the offer right away.

He went home, opened his spreadsheet of job comparisons. Logical breakdowns. Pros and cons. Weightage scores.

But for once, the numbers didn’t help.

So he messaged Aleem.

> *You ever make a decision just because it felt right, even if it made no sense?*

Aleem’s reply came fast.

> *My entire relationship with Hana, bro.*

> *You thinking of making a jump?*

> *Possibly.*

> *Then stop waiting for the spreadsheet to tell you how to feel. Your gut already knows.*

---

He took the job.

Two weeks’ notice handed in, contract signed, orientation scheduled.

He told his girlfriend over ramen at a quiet street stall.

She smiled. “Finally.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You knew?”

“I’ve known for a while. You’ve been quietly frustrated — not because you were unhappy, but because you weren’t being challenged.”

He looked at her for a long moment.

Then, softly: “Thanks for waiting.”

She leaned in. “Always.”
