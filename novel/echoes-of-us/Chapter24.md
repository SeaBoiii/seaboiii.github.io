## Chapter 24: Learning the Unwritten

Ivan’s new workplace had no clock-in machine.

No fixed seats. No dress code. No two days that looked the same.

The first week, he nearly went insane.

People talked mid-meeting. Debates broke out over lunch. Someone put up a whiteboard titled *“Things We Failed At This Week”* like it was a point of pride.

Ivan stared at it for two full minutes.  
Then added: *“Misjudged server load on routing map v2.1”*  
Next day, someone left him a sticky note:  
> *Respect. Welcome to the chaos.*

---

He started small.

Organizing the backlog. Fixing naming conventions. Creating documentation nobody asked for — but everyone quietly appreciated.

They called him *The Backbone*.

He didn’t hate it.

---

One Friday, after a particularly long brainstorm, one of the engineers asked him out for drinks.

Ivan was about to say no. He never stayed out late on Fridays — it was relationship night.

Then he paused. And messaged her.

> *Drinks with the team. Mind if I’m back later?*

She replied immediately.

> *Go. Socialize. I’ll save you some mango pudding.*

He smiled.

And said yes.

That night, he sat under fairy lights in a cramped rooftop bar, surrounded by laughter and half-empty pints. Someone started talking about love and how dating in tech was “statistically doomed.”

Someone else turned to him.  
“You’ve been in a long-term thing, right? Since forever?”

Ivan nodded.

“What’s the secret, man?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Then, quietly:  
“Grow without leaving each other behind.”

A few heads nodded. Someone toasted to that.

He didn’t say more.

But he messaged her later that night.

> *I like this version of me. The one learning to bend.*

She replied:

> *That version of you has always been here. You just finally gave him permission to speak.*

---

He still wrote in his journal, late at night.

But now the entries had different tones.

> *Today I laughed louder.  
Let someone interrupt me.  
Let myself enjoy the mess.  
This life isn’t spreadsheet-shaped — and that’s okay.  
Maybe even good.*
