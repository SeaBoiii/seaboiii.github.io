Morning in Singapore was doing its soft work again--humidity polishing the edges of everything, the light already bright but not yet loud. Aleem stood at the kitchen counter and watched the kettle come to a boil the way he used to watch a stage clock tick toward doors.

On the fridge, his mother's note sat under a magnet shaped like a tiny MRT train Aoi had bought for her: *Girl landing 2:10. Don't go airport. Dinner at home. Wipe stove.* A smiley.

He did not go to the airport.

That used to be a rule he repeated to keep his own heart in check. Now it was a rule that kept their life clean.

At 1:48 p.m., his phone buzzed.

*A: Landed. Green. Taxi to hotel. I will text "home" when in.*

*Aleem: Copy. Lobby 6:30. Then home for dinner. Public first. Proceed by invitation.*

*A: Proceed.*

He put the phone face down and finished slicing ginger for soup, because soup was still policy, and because chopping was the kind of prayer his hands understood.

***

The lobby bench squeaked as usual. Aleem had started to believe the bench did it on purpose, a tiny reminder to keep things ordinary. Aoi stepped out of the lift with her carry‑on, cap on until she chose the room. When she did, she removed it and breathed out--a human exhale, not a performative one.

"Evening," she said.

"Evening," he replied. "Rules?"

"No photos. Phones for time. Public first. We proceed by invitation." She lifted her palm--flat--two taps, one hold; three light taps. "Here. Stay. Air."

"Here," he returned. "Stay. Air."

She smiled, small and warm. "You look like you've been eating," she said.

"My mother feeds me like it's her job," he said.

"She will feed me too," Aoi replied, and the sentence was both hope and proof that she'd learned the auntie constitution.

They took the MRT like citizens, then a bus, then walked the last stretch under a sky that had decided not to rain yet. Aoi kept her body language modest, face in lowercase, steps aligned to the quiet rhythm they'd practiced across cities.

At the lift lobby, a neighbor's auntie glanced at Aoi and smiled the knowing smile of someone who has watched Aleem grow from "good boy" into "adult man" without needing details.

"Hello," the auntie said.

"Hello," Aoi said back, bowing just enough to be respectful in the Singapore way.

The auntie nodded. "Eat already?" she asked, because that is the Singapore love language.

"Not yet," Aoi answered.

"Good," the auntie said. "Then go."

***

His mother opened the door before Aleem could fish for his keys. She looked at Aoi, then at the tote in Aoi's hand, then at the way Aoi's eyes immediately went to the shoe rack.

"Girl," she said.

"Aoi," Aoi corrected gently, bowing hinge‑perfect.

His mother's mouth did the satisfied shape. "Aoi," she said in return. "Come in. Wash hands. Aleem, take her bag. Don't narrate."

"Yes, Ma," Aleem said automatically.

Aoi echoed it with a grin. "Yes, Ma."

His mother laughed with teeth, the rare loud kind that meant she was relaxed enough to be amused. "Eh, you two," she said, waving them in. "Today we eat simple. Soup. Fish. Vegetables. Correct. Not pretty."

"Correct," Aoi said, and Aleem watched the word land in the kitchen as if it had always lived there.

They cooked as a three‑person committee. Aleem did the prep; Aoi washed and sliced; his mother ran the stove like a department chair who didn't need to raise her voice. Ginger hit hot oil and turned into a smell that made the entire flat feel older in a good way.

At the table, his mother began with her favorite kind of blessing: instruction.

"Eat," she said. "Then talk."

They ate. The fish was honest. The soup was kind. Aoi's shoulders lowered with every spoonful, her body learning again that she didn't have to be ready for cameras after every swallow.

When the rice pot clicked off, his mother finally asked, "Tokyo okay?"

Aoi answered in nouns. "Work okay. People kind. Quiet bridge spreading. I have a drawer for sentences. I sleep more. I don't scroll. I say 'library closed' and mean it."

His mother nodded. "Good. Rest is allowed. Aleem also learned." She looked at him. "He doesn't answer every message now. He mops the floor."

Aoi laughed softly. "I'm proud of you," she told him.

Aleem's throat tightened. "I'm practicing," he said.

His mother rose, taking plates with the authority of someone ending a meeting. "You two go walk later," she announced. "Botanic Gardens tomorrow morning. Early. No heat. No crowds. I already decided."

Aoi blinked. "You decided?"

His mother shrugged. "I like Gardens. And I like you both when you walk. Less talking, more breathing. Go. Now wash dishes as if you were brought up properly."

"Yes, Ma," Aleem said.

"Yes, Ma," Aoi echoed.

***

Night in the flat was domestic--fans humming, dishes drying, the radio murmuring news about rain that might or might not show up. In the corridor, mahjong tiles argued politely with each other.

Aoi stood by the window after the dishes were done, looking out at the void deck lights like they were a different kind of stage.

"Bench report?" Aleem asked softly.

Aoi turned, her face tired but not brittle. "Bench… good," she said. "Singapore makes me… less watched."

He nodded. "Tokyo is still learning."

"It will," she said. Then, after a breath between counts, "Aleem."

"Yes."

"I want to say something without making it heavy," she said. "When you stepped down, the room didn't collapse. That taught me something. We don't need to be needed to be loved."

He felt the sentence settle like a book placed gently on a shelf.

"Thank you," he said.

"Thank you," she replied.

They didn't kiss in the corridor. They didn't need to. They touched palms briefly in the kitchen doorway--two taps, one hold, three light taps--and then said good night like adults.

***

Botanic Gardens before nine is a different country. The air smells like wet soil and citrus and the first wave of gardeners deciding the world should be tidy. The sky was pale, forgiving.

Aleem met Aoi at the gate. No hotel lobby today--his mother had insisted Aoi sleep in their spare room because "taxi money is still money." Aoi emerged with a small umbrella and a cap that apologized to the sun.

"Morning," she said.

"Morning," he replied. "Rules?"

"No photos. Phones for time only. Public first. We proceed by invitation." She lifted her palm--two taps, one hold; three light taps.

"Here," she said. "Stay. Air."

"Here," he answered. "Stay. Air."

They walked the path past the Bandstand, past Swan Lake, into the quieter corners where tourists hadn't yet learned what to do with their hands. They chose the Learning Forest boardwalk because it was narrow enough to make people slow down.

Aoi looked at the water below, dark and still. "This place still smells like beginnings," she said.

"It also smells like maintenance," he replied, and she laughed.

They found the bench under the tembusu--the one that had hosted so many of their drafts--and sat the way you sit when you don't need to be watched. Aoi set her umbrella beside her like a respectful prop.

Aleem felt the wooden bench token in his pocket and the paper museum behind his ribs, all the sentences that had carried them from Tekong to Tokyo to this morning.

He didn't rush.

"May I say something?" he asked.

Aoi turned toward him. "Please."

"My life used to be a series of rooms I tried to keep safe for other people," he said. "Army rooms. Work rooms. Stadium rooms. The fandom room." He breathed once, let the count steady him. "Then you taught me there can be a room that is ours, and it doesn't need an audience. It just needs… us behaving."

Aoi's eyes softened. "Yes," she said.

He reached into his tote and took out a small square box, plain, no velvet drama. He didn't open it yet.

Aoi didn't inhale sharply. She didn't perform surprise. She only watched, present, the way she watched the first time she saw his **THANK YOU, CREW** cards rise without becoming a sea.

Aleem set the box on the bench between them and kept his hands visible.

"May I ask a question that is… a future?" he said.

Aoi's hand floated toward the box, then stopped in the air. She looked at his face like an adult doing a careful check.

"Yes," she said. "Ask."

He opened the box.

Inside was a simple ring--no loud stone, just a clean band with a small detail etched on the inside: *here / stay / air.* He had chosen it because it was not a trophy. It was a rule.

Aleem's voice stayed steady, not because he was fearless, but because he trusted the room.

"Aoi," he said, "will you choose a life with me? Slow. Boring on purpose. With rules that glow in the dark. With soup policy and time zones and trays returned. With you as a person, not a poster. With me as a bench, not wind."

He paused, then added the last clause, because consent is not romance without escape routes.

"And if you say no, I will thank you. And we will still keep the room kind."

Aoi's eyes filled, not as performance, but as a body doing what bodies do when they recognize something true.

She did not reach for the ring immediately. She placed her palm on the bench between them and tapped--two taps, one hold; three light taps.

Here. Stay. Air.

Aleem mirrored, his hand flat on the wood.

Aoi took a breath that sounded like the beginning of a song and then said, simply:

"Yes."

Aleem's chest went quiet in the way it goes quiet after a long march ends and nobody has to pretend it wasn't hard.

He didn't put the ring on her finger yet.

"May I?" he asked.

Aoi smiled through the wetness in her eyes. "Please," she said. "Proceed by invitation."

He took her hand gently, sliding the ring on with the care of someone placing a bookmark into a book he intends to read slowly. When the band settled, she exhaled like someone finally sitting down.

"Okay?" he asked.

"Okay," she answered. "More than okay."

Aleem lifted two fingers to his cheekbone--the request signal they had invented for kisses--and waited.

Aoi mirrored, then tilted forward.

Yes.

Their kiss was soft, private, and brief enough to belong in a garden. Two in, hold one, three out. Aleem pulled back first, because after is care.

"Okay?" he asked again.

Aoi laughed once, a small release. "Okay," she said. "I'm… engaged." She looked at her hand like the ring had changed the weather. "This is ridiculous."

"It's useful," he corrected.

She laughed harder. "Useful is our romance."

They sat on the bench and did not rush to stand up and tell the world. The world didn't need to know yet. The room did.

Aoi rested her head on his shoulder for one count. Aleem stayed furniture and felt grateful for the job.

"What do we tell your mother?" Aoi asked finally.

"We tell her after lunch," he said. "So she can feed us before she scolds us for not eating."

Aoi smiled, touching the ring with her thumb. "Correct," she said.

***

His mother knew before they said anything.

They returned to the flat with damp hair and calmer eyes. The kitchen already smelled like lunch decisions. His mother stood at the counter with a knife, slicing tomatoes as if she had been waiting for this exact moment all morning.

She looked at Aoi's hand.

She looked at Aleem's face.

Then she nodded once, slow and satisfied.

"Eat first," she said.

"Ma," Aleem started.

"Eat," she repeated, more firmly. "Then you talk."

They obeyed, because democracy has rules.

After two spoonfuls of soup, Aoi lifted her hand slightly, ring catching the kitchen light in a way that looked like it had always belonged there.

"Mdm Rahman," she said carefully. "We… would like to marry. If you approve."

His mother placed her spoon down and looked at them with the kind of tenderness that doesn't get talked about enough in Asian houses because it's too efficient to be poetic.

"I approve," she said. "Because you two are boring and correct. Because you ask. Because you don't turn each other into content. Because you eat."

Aoi's shoulders released the last of their travel tension. "Thank you," she whispered.

His mother waved her hand as if swatting a mosquito. "Thank me by returning trays," she said. "And by keeping your faith with your rules. Also, ring nice. Not too showy. Correct."

Aleem laughed into his bowl. Aoi laughed too, wiping a tear with the back of her hand like a person who had forgotten she was allowed to cry.

His mother stood, went to the drawer, and pulled out a small packet.

"Aoi," she said, and pushed it across the table. "For you."

Inside was a small stack of handkerchiefs, folded like origami, embroidered with a white crane at the corner.

Aoi stared. "White crane," she breathed.

His mother shrugged. "You always look like crane," she said. "Quiet but strong. Now you are family, you keep tissue properly. Also, this one for tears. Not content."

Aoi bowed her head, moved.

"Thank you," she said again.

"Good," his mother replied. "Now, you both, go rest. Rest is allowed."

***

That night, after the dishes were done and the stove had been wiped because the stove was part of their religion, Aleem stood in front of his locker door's paper museum.

He added one final square, cut from the corner of a calendar that had long ago stopped being a schedule and become a witness:

*Between counts, we chose each other.*

He pressed it into place under *Proceed by invitation* and above *Be the bench.*

Aoi stood beside him, finger tracing the edges of the umbrella-hands photo behind the paper--secret exhibit, no algorithm in sight.

"Your museum is full," she said softly.

"It can always hold one more sentence," he replied.

She lifted her palm--two taps; one hold; three light taps.

Here. Stay. Air.

He returned it.

Here. Stay. Air.

Then he touched two fingers to his cheekbone--request.

Aoi mirrored and leaned in.

Their kiss tasted like tea and soup and all the quiet parts that had saved them.

After, they sat on the edge of the bed and looked at the ring again as if it were a timetable they had agreed to follow.

"What now?" Aoi asked.

"Now," Aleem said, "we keep being boring. We plan. We tell your parents when you're ready. We choose a date that respects your work and your rest. We build shelves and keep jars honest."

Aoi smiled. "And we don't be the headline."

"Never," he agreed.

Outside, Singapore did what it always did after a big decision: it kept its buses on route, kept its hawker centres loud, kept its rain for later. Somewhere, a fan printed a lyric card and decided to recycle it properly. Somewhere, a stagehand coiled cable and went home with less ringing in his ears.

Aleem lay on his side facing the wall that had memorized his breath since Tekong and counted with the person who had become his quiet.

Two in, hold one, three out.

Respect. Distance. Gratitude.

Between counts, they had chosen each other.

And because they chose it slowly, it felt like it would last.
