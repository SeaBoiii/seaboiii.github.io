The first month apart did not feel like distance the way movies insist distance must feel. It felt like clocks learning new habits.

Singapore stayed humid and familiar--MRT platform hum, kopi steam, the clean aggression of office fluorescent lights. Tokyo lived six long train stations away in time: convenience store warmth at midnight, studio resin on floors, the sea wind that lives in alleys if you know which way to turn. Between them, the Charter sat like a small bridge on paper--**Yes is specific. No saves futures. Maybe is honorable.** And below that, in their private dialect: **morning green/amber, night one word.**

The morning after she flew back, Aleem woke before his alarm like a person who had inherited a new job. He lay on his side, counted his breath once out of habit, then reached for his phone only after his feet found the floor.

*A: Amber. Jet lag polite but present. Studio orientation at 11. Heart okay.*

He stared at the message until his shoulders stopped trying to answer like a hero. *Amber* meant caution and kindness, not panic.

*Aleem: Copy. Amber = soup policy + fewer decisions. I won't send novels. If you want nothing, say "library closed."*

*A: Library closed until lunch. Thank you. Proceed.*

He placed the phone face down as if returning a tool to the correct drawer. In the kitchen, his mother was already rinsing rice like she wanted the day to behave.

"She landed?" she asked.

"She landed," he said.

"Then you eat," his mother said, as if this were a law passed unanimously by aunties worldwide. "Don't let your stomach become drama."

"Yes, Ma."

She slid an omelette onto a plate and watched him with the same radar she'd always used--measuring not romance, but stability. "Time zones are noisy," she said. "Don't become wind. Be bench."

"I'll be bench," he promised, and meant it.

***

Work tried to pretend nothing had changed. Emails, meetings, a spreadsheet that needed gentler verbs. Yet his phone, face down most of the day, carried a second city like a pocket with a hidden seam.

At 1:12 p.m., a message arrived.

*A: Green. Studio smells like resin + coffee. Feet okay. People kind but busy. I found a bench by a vending machine.*

He smiled at the last sentence like it was a postcard with no picture.

*Aleem: Green received. I'm at a bench that is my desk chair pretending to be a throne. Drink water. If anyone tries wind, show them your "no" in lowercase.*

*A: Toolbox?*

He blinked, caught. His shoulders had been rising without permission.

*Aleem: Yes. Toolbox activated. I will bench. Thank you for catching.*

*A: Bench approved. Later: "home."*

He set the phone face down again. Nadiah from finance walked past, glanced at him, and said the kindest thing in an office: "Lunch already?"

"Lunch already," he replied, grateful for normal questions.

***

The first friction arrived on Day Five, small as a grain of rice stuck to the side of a pot.

It was 10:58 p.m. Singapore time. Aleem had already done the ritual--wash dishes, wipe stove, set the fan to the rain setting even though the rain outside was doing the job itself. He'd sent his one-word check-in at 10:45: *Home.*

The reply didn't come.

He held steady until 11:20, then felt the old urge to build a story out of silence--an instinct trained by army nights and heartbreak. He picked up his phone, put it down. Picked it up again, hovered over the keyboard.

*Peppermint.*

He sent it, and immediately regretted sending anything after eleven. The Charter would have scolded him like a librarian.

Then, at 11:31, her message arrived.

*A: Home. Sorry. Fell asleep with makeup on. I am now washing my face like a guilty citizen. Peppermint?*

He exhaled so hard his chest unclenched with a noise.

*Aleem: Peppermint = brain tried to invent a storm. I'm okay. No fixing needed. Just naming it.*

*A: Thank you for naming. Library closed means sleep. I'm proud you used the word instead of turning it into a paragraph.*

He laughed quietly into his pillow. In the dark, he touched the cheekbone signal to his own face--request, but not for more messages. Request for himself to be gentle.

*Aleem: After is care. Good night.*

*A: After is care. Good night.*

He put the phone face down and slept like a person whose rules had saved him from himself.

***

The first care package happened the following Saturday, because Aleem's hands needed a place to put their worry that wasn't a keyboard.

He packed it like he packed volunteer handouts: practical, polite, no extra adjectives. A tin of pineapple tarts for her manager (because people who guard schedules deserve bribery that doesn't smell like bribery). A small jar of Singapore chili jam labeled in lowercase--*courage / use slowly*. A packet of Milo because nostalgia travels well. A set of new cotton handkerchiefs folded like origami, because her grandmother's drawer had taught him that cloth can carry sentences. And, folded into the side pocket, a laminated **Borrowed Breath** card translated into Japanese with a new line at the bottom:

*If you can't sleep, don't scroll. Count. Drink water. Text "library closed."*

He didn't include anything that said *I miss you* in capital letters. He included a small note on cream stock:

*For your drawer. For your knees. For your water bottle. No need to reply fast. We are boring on purpose.*

At the post office, the auntie behind the counter eyed the box, then eyed him. "Send to Japan?" she asked, as if Japan were a cousin who had moved away.

"Send to Tokyo," he said.

"Girl ah," she observed, not a question.

He smiled carefully. "Girl," he agreed.

Auntie hummed, weighed the box, then tapped the label. "Write phone number big. Japan people very serious."

"Yes, auntie."

When the box slid away on the belt, his chest felt lighter--not because distance disappeared, but because he'd placed his care somewhere that could travel without becoming pressure.

***

Aoi's first workshop as "not an idol, not yet anything else" happened on Week Two.

She didn't call it a debut. The event listing, in Japanese and English, read like a museum placard: **Audience Comfort Practices -- Quiet Bridge**. Venue: a small black box theater near Shimokitazawa. Capacity: 30. Filming: none.

The night before, her message came.

*A: Green. Tomorrow workshop. I'm nervous in a new way. Not stage nervous. Teacher nervous.*

Aleem sat on his bed and let the urge to write a motivational essay climb his throat and then lie down again.

*Aleem: Green received. Teacher nervous is correct. Remember: you built rooms before you knew the word. Staff first. Bench before wind. If it helps, I'll be row ten from Singapore.*

*A: Row ten makes me laugh. Okay. I will teach in nouns.*

The next day, he took annual leave for one afternoon hour and set up his desk like a tiny watch party for one.

There was no stream. There were no photos. That was the point.

He simply made tea, pulled out his notebook, and wrote a schedule in Singapore time: 2:00 p.m.--she starts. 2:20--breath exercise. 2:45--Q&A. 3:00--done. He treated it like a prayer timetable. At each marker, he counted his breath once--two in, hold one, three out--and imagined a room in Tokyo learning to keep hands low.

At 3:12 p.m., a message arrived.

*A: Home.*

One word. But it was a room opening.

*Aleem: Home.*

He didn't ask for details. He wanted her to keep her work clean. A few minutes later, another message came anyway.

*A: It worked. People asked for the "no phones above shoulder" sign like it was a gift. A woman cried quietly and said she could finally watch without fear of doing it wrong. I thought of your library boys. Thank you for teaching me we don't need to be loud to be real.*

His eyes stung. He let them. He didn't post, didn't screenshot, didn't turn it into proof.

*Aleem: You did it. Rest is allowed now. Eat. Drink water. Then sleep.*

*A: Library closed.*

He smiled into his tea like a man who had learned to accept boundaries as love.

***

Week Three brought a second friction--this one not about silence, but about presence.

It was a Sunday afternoon in Singapore, which meant it was evening in Tokyo. He had just finished grocery unpacking--labels in lowercase because Aoi's handwriting had colonized his shelves--and his mother had called him to carry laundry because the sun was behaving.

His phone buzzed.

*A: Green. Can we call? Ten minutes?*

A call was a big room. Calls have edges. Calls also have the ability to become a habit that eats the rest of your life if you aren't careful.

He felt the temptation to say yes immediately, because he missed the sound of her laugh landing in real time. Then he felt the Charter in his pocket like a hand on his shoulder.

He typed slowly.

*Aleem: I want to. I'm in laundry duty now. Can we do 9:30 your time? 15 minutes, timer on. If tired appears, we stop.*

There was a pause long enough for his old self to invent a storm.

Then.

*A: Thank you for not making me ask twice. 9:30 okay. Timer on. I like that you choose me without dropping your mother.*

He swallowed hard and stared at the phone as if it had said something holy.

At 9:30 Tokyo time (8:30 Singapore), he sat at his desk and called.

Her face appeared, soft-lit, hair towel-wrapped like a person who had returned from war and chosen shampoo as therapy. No makeup. No performance. Just skin and tired eyes and a grin that arrived anyway.

"Hello," she said, voice half pillow.

"Hello," he replied.

They kept it small. Two minutes on how her feet felt. Two minutes on how his mother had declared the new chili jam acceptable. One minute on how she had accidentally bought the wrong train ticket and had to ask for help like a human. She laughed at herself and he felt his chest unclench.

At minute ten, the timer beeped softly.

She held up two fingers to her cheekbone, the request signal.

He mirrored, then tapped his desk--caption.

"Later?" he asked.

"Later," she said, pressing her palm to the screen the way people touch glass when they can't touch skin. "Thank you for timer. It makes me feel… safe."

"After is care," he said.

"After is care," she echoed.

They hung up without adding unnecessary tragedy to good nights.

***

It was in Week Four that Aleem finally did the thing he'd been circling since Chapter One: he stepped back.

Not from her. From the version of himself the community still needed, but not in the same way.

The Telegram channel had been kind through Announcement Week. It had practiced what he taught. And now, with Tokyo behind them, the group chat began to turn into something else--nostalgia sharp enough to cut, theories about "next projects," flight tracking disguised as hope. Nothing illegal. But close enough to wind that he could smell it.

He could not be both bench for Aoi and anchor for a thousand hearts that would, inevitably, lean too hard on the wrong places.

That night, he sat at his desk, opened a blank post, and typed a title:

**Community Update -- Transition**

His hands hesitated. He felt the weight of row ten--the years of being careful, the hours of taping floor lanes and teaching people to lower phones and thank crew. He felt the pride of a room that had learned to be kind.

Then he remembered the Charter line: *We keep work clean. Love separate.*

He wrote.

**Hi everyone.**  
Tokyo is done. We did it properly. Thank you for being audience the way our future selves will be proud of.

From this point, I'm stepping down from active lead duties. Not disappearing--just moving into a lighter, back‑row role.

**Why:** This community deserves leaders who can stay fully focused on fandom without complicated conflicts. Also: rest is allowed. For me too.

**What stays:** our practices. Quiet Bridge. Crew thanks. No airport/hotel/studio proximity talk. Archive, not feed. Hotline resources when storms hit.

**What changes:** I won't be running meetups, coordinating volunteer shifts, or acting as the "first responder" for rumor cycles. Zara and Kai will guide the mods. I'll support quietly when asked.

**One last request:** keep the room kind even when no one is watching. That's the whole point.

Respect, distance, gratitude. Always.

He read it twice and didn't press send.

Not yet.

Because endings, even small ones, deserve consent too.

His phone buzzed.

*A: Green. Package arrived. Pineapple tarts made my manager smile like a human. The handkerchiefs are in my drawer. The chili jam is dangerous; I respect it. Thank you.*

He stared at the message, then at the unsent post. He felt the two lives he was building touch edges and not tear.

*Aleem: I'm glad it arrived. Please eat, then sleep. Also--small note: I'm going to step down from the fan lead role soon. Not because of you--because of balance. I want to keep us clean.*

There was a pause.

Then:

*A: Thank you. That is the most respectful thing you could do. I am proud of you. After is care. Sleep now.*

His throat tightened. He didn't let it become speech.

*Aleem: After is care. Good night.*

*A: Good night. Here. Stay. Air.*

He placed the phone face down and pressed his palm flat against the desk--two taps, one hold, three light taps--responding to a person six hundred kilometers away the only way he could: by keeping his own room kind.

In the dark, he looked at the post again. His finger hovered over send.

Not yet.

But soon.

Because some chapters end with a decision you're still breathing into.

And some beginnings arrive only when you let go of the old seat on purpose.

Two in, hold one, three out.

Respect. Distance. Gratitude.

The screen waited. The city outside softened into night. Somewhere in Tokyo, a drawer held handkerchiefs and sentences. Somewhere in Singapore, a man prepared to step back from a crowd so he could step forward into a life that didn't need to be watched to be true.
