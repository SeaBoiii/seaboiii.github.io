The rain came soft over Toa Payoh, fine as silk on the HDB corridor. In Aleem’s living room, a lone lamp pooled amber light across the coffee table where an origami white crane waited beside two mugs. The ceiling fan ticked on a slow count. Outside, the MRT’s distant breath folded into the weather.

Aoi stood by the window, hair tucked behind one ear, tracing the water beads running down the glass. She wore a simple knit and jeans, cuffs rolled like a rehearsal habit. The room carried faint notes of evening kopi-O kosong and the lift lobby’s neutral hum. Quiet as a gift.

*Don’t rush it.* He lined the coasters without needing to, settling the tiny restlessness in his hands.

She turned. “May I sit here?”

He smiled, shifting to make space on the sofa, angling his body toward her without crowding. “Please.”

They found the same angle and stayed there.

For a moment they only listened: rain, fan, a neighbor’s muted TV two floors down. Aleem offered the mug nearer her hand. “Careful. It’s still hot.”

Her fingers brushed his as she accepted it—warmth meeting warmth. Aoi breathed in the steam like it was stage fog that knew how to be gentle. “This is nice,” she said, her voice soft but sure. “The quiet parts.”

He nodded. “They always felt like the real song.”

She smiled at that—brief, precise. She took another sip, then noticed the crane. “Yours?”

“I folded it after your last Singapore show,” he said, pulse kicking once in his throat. “Row twelve felt…close. I wanted to remember the calm you carry between counts.”

Her gaze softened. “May I?” She reached for the crane and waited.

“Of course.”

She lifted it lightly, as if it could startle, turning it between thoughtful fingers. “It’s kind,” she said. “The way you fold your attention.”

He swallowed. *Say the thing that matters, then wait.* “I stepped down from the fan group,” he said. “Before we…began this. I wanted no shadows between us.”

Aoi’s shoulders eased. “Thank you.” She set the crane back on the table, aligning it with the mug as if restoring a choreography. “I’ve spent years being seen from far away. I’m learning how to be seen up close without… performing.”

“Is this okay?” he asked. He kept his voice even. “Us. This room. Tonight being just—quiet.”

She looked at him then, really looked, and the room learned their quiet. “Yes.”

They stayed in that yes for several breaths. Rain beat a steadier metronome against the pane. Aleem noticed the small curve of her thumb around the mug, the faint pink at her knuckles where the heat touched. A simple thing, and it felt like a door opening.

He risked a small movement, palm up between them on the cushion. “If you want,” he said. “But only if.”

Her hand hovered, then came to rest on his, light as the crane’s paper wing. Her skin was cool from the window glass, then warming. “This is okay,” she said.

They sat with it—the contact, the fan’s unhurried spin, the lift stopping somewhere down the block and opening to someone else’s evening. When she shifted a fraction closer, their knees drew a quiet parallel. Aleem matched her breath without intending to: in on four, out on four, the old rehearsal count he’d learned for her sake and kept for his own.

“I used to think,” she began, eyes on the window again, “that love would kill the dance. The way gossip did. The way schedules did. But this—” she glanced down at their hands, “—feels like the breath between counts. Not the end of the music.”

“It feels like the part you choose,” he said.

She laughed—soft, arriving at the edge of a note and not needing to fall. “You always turn things into care.”

“Practice,” he said. “And wanting to get it right.”

She lifted her free hand to his cheek, pausing an inch short. “May I?”

He leaned the smallest degree into the question. “Please.”

Her fingers came to rest along his jaw, careful, mapping warmth. He could smell rain, shampoo, and the faint sweetness of kopi lingering on her breath. Aleem kept his hands where they were, letting her lead, letting permission be the point.

“Can I kiss you?” he asked, the words steady and plain.

She didn’t answer immediately. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, then mirrored his palm-up gesture with her left hand, inviting his fingers in. “Yes,” she said. “But slowly.”

They met in the quiet middle. The first touch was barely there—more promise than press. They paused, checking each other with a shared breath. The second kiss had shape, tender and unhurried, the kind that learned as it went. Her hand slid to the back of his neck; his thumb traced the ridge of her second knuckle, asking with the lightest pressure if this was still okay.

“This okay?” he murmured.

“Yes,” she breathed, and he felt it more than heard it.

Rain softened on the windows. Somewhere, a neighbor’s kettle clicked off. They pulled back by a centimeter that felt like a mile, eyes open, both a little surprised by how gentle could feel so complete.

“I want to be careful with you,” he said.

“I know.” She touched her forehead to his, a quiet bow. “And I want to be here.”

They settled deeper into the sofa, shoulders a single line. Aoi rested her head on his collarbone, and he adjusted the cushion behind her without breaking the thread. He let his hand settle at her wrist where the pulse lived, a steady small drum beneath his thumb.

“Tell me your boundaries,” she said, tracing absent circles at his shoulder—circles that could have been stage marks, could have been weather.

He smiled, grateful. “We name it as we go. We stop the moment either of us wants to. No apologies for that. And… tonight, I want the kind of closeness that still lets us breathe.”

She exhaled, the kind that empties a long room. “Same.”

He pressed his mouth to her hair, then paused, letting the question hang again. “This okay?”

She nodded against his collarbone. “It is.”

They lingered in small touches: the lean of her knee against his thigh, the slide of his palm along her forearm, the way she laced their fingers then unlaced them as if learning two steps to the same phrase. When they kissed again, it was easier and not at all less new.

“Tomorrow,” she said between breaths, “National Gallery?”

“Yeah. We’ll sit with the light.”

“We’ll sit with each other,” she said, and the echo warmed him.

He let his hand rise to cup her cheek, thumb resting by the corner of her mouth. “Aoi?”

“Mm?”

“If at any point—”

“I’ll tell you,” she said, finishing the sentence like a duet. “Will you?”

“I will.”

They smiled at the neatness of it, the clean line of an agreement made without weight. Their next kiss was slower still, the world quietly rearranging to make room. The ceiling fan kept count over them: one, two, three, four. The rain answered: hush, hush, hush.

They found that shared breath again and held it—not as a rule, but as a choice. And when the moment asked to deepen, they asked each other too.

“Okay?” he murmured.

“Okay,” she said, and her hands framed his face like a favorite song.

The lamp cast a gentler circle as the rain thinned. Outside, the corridor’s light flicked off on its sensor, giving them the small mercy of dusk inside their room. Between counts, they chose each other, and the scene folded into a quiet the city would not interrupt.

—fade—

Later, they sat shoulder-to-shoulder again, sipping water and letting silence do the talking. He fetched a light throw and tucked it over both their knees, then waited.

“Thank you,” she said.

“For what?”

“For asking.”

He nodded. “Thank you for answering.”

She looked at the crane, now angled toward them as if listening. “Keep this,” she said. “Bring it tomorrow.”

“To the Gallery?”

She nodded. “A reminder. Of the breath between counts.”

Outside, the rain stopped like a line cut clean. Somewhere in the block, a child laughed, the sound skipped across wet concrete and faded. Aleem turned the crane so its wings aligned with the lamp’s curve. The room learned their quiet again. And in that quiet, they let the night stay simple—warmth, water, the promise of morning light on museum floors, and the small white crane keeping time.
