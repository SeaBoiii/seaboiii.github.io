The first longer visit was not announced. It arrived like laundry that had finished drying--quiet, ordinary, suddenly ready.

Her flight landed on a Thursday afternoon, chosen not for romance but for cheaper seats and kinder immigration lines. Aleem did not go to the airport. That was one of the rules that made the rest of their rules possible.

Instead, he went to the post office on his lunch break and mailed a registered letter for work, returned a tin to the bakery auntie with a "thank you" that sounded like a habit, and bought two extra bottles of barley because bodies do better when hydrated even during joy.

At 5:52 p.m., his phone buzzed.

*A: Landed. Green. Taxi to hotel. I will text "home" when in.*

*Aleem: Copy. Dinner plan: hawker, not fancy. Public first. I'll meet you at lobby at 8:15.*

*A: Proceed. Cap apologizes to wind.*

He put the phone face down and finished his spreadsheet like a man who knew how to respect both a paycheck and a person.

***

The hotel was boring in exactly the correct way. Quiet lobby. Staff who did not widen their eyes. No flowers that tried to look like an apology. Aoi had chosen it herself, as part of their Charter's clause: *We do not turn logistics into proof.*

Aleem arrived at 8:05, because punctuality is a kind of care that doesn't touch skin. He waited by the side bench near the concierge--public, visible, nothing that looked like secrecy. The bench squeaked, which made him feel loyal to it.

Aoi came down the lift in linen and fatigue, cap on until she chose the room. When she did, she removed it, tucked it into her tote, and breathed out the kind of breath that says *I'm safe enough to be a person now.*

"Evening," she said.

"Evening," he replied. "Rules?"

"No photos. Phones for time. Public first. We proceed by invitation." She lifted her palm, flat--two taps; one hold; three light taps. "Here. Stay. Air."

"Here," he returned. "Stay. Air."

She smiled without teeth. "You look… normal," she said, like it surprised her.

"I am normal on purpose," he said. "Our favorite rebellion."

***

They took the MRT like citizens, not like story. City Hall station's hum wrapped them in the familiar Singapore chorus. They stood on the side of the platform where people who don't like being jostled choose to be. Aoi watched the route map like it was choreography.

"Where?" she asked.

"Amoy," he said. "Crowded but honest. The aunties judge quietly."

"I accept judgment," she said.

At Amoy, the air smelled like garlic and ambition being fed. They queued for carrot cake, black, because this had become a form of shared religion. They got iced barley and kopi‑o kosong and claimed a table that had survived a thousand dinners.

They kept their bodies small. Hands low. Faces neutral. Aoi listened to the room's volume and matched it. Aleem watched her do it and felt pride that had nothing to do with possession.

The near‑miss arrived as a group of office kids doing that thing where they walk too close, hoping for a coincidence. One phone rose to chest height, not yet above shoulder.

Aoi beat them to it with the simplest weapon: courtesy. "Hi," she said softly. "We're eating."

The kids froze, then laughed at themselves into adulthood. "Sorry," one whispered. "Enjoy."

"Thank you," she said, and returned to her plate as if the world had not tried to turn her into content. Aleem felt his chest settle.

"Nice," he murmured.

"We practiced," she said.

***

They walked to the river after dinner because walking is a way to let food become comfort instead of weight. Boat Quay lights did their usual performance; water refused to be impressed.

Aoi leaned on the railing, the city behind her like a quiet chorus. "I missed humidity," she confessed. "Tokyo air is too clean. It makes me feel like I must be clean too."

"Singapore lets you be messy," he said. "As long as you return tray."

She laughed once, relief audible. "I brought something," she said, and opened her tote.

Not a gift meant to be posted. A small zip pouch--her handwriting on a tag: *drawer / sentences.* Inside: a new keycard holder, plain black, with a tiny stitched bench at the corner.

"For you," she said. "So your cards stop falling out of your pocket and making you look like a man who is always losing permissions."

He rolled the holder between finger and thumb, touched the stitched bench. "This is… painfully useful," he said.

"Useful is my romance," she replied, eyes warm.

He took a breath, then asked, because the question mattered in the way small questions do. "May I hug you?"

She didn't answer with a rush. She checked the river, the walkway, the distance to the nearest bench. Public first. Then she nodded once, the hinge.

"Yes," she said. "One breath."

He stepped in and held her the way you hold a bowl you don't want to spill--firm enough to say *you're here*, gentle enough to say *you can leave anytime.* One breath: two in, hold, three out. He released first.

"Okay?" he asked.

"Okay," she said, and the word sounded like a door closing gently.

They parted at the MRT entrance like citizens. No drama. No lingering. Her hotel was a short walk; his home was a bus.

"Tomorrow," she said. "Your mother's kitchen? If she approves."

"I asked," he said. "She approved before I finished the sentence."

Aoi smiled like a person about to be fed into belonging. "Proceed," she said.

***

His mother's house rules were already active when Aoi arrived the next morning.

Mdm Rahman opened the door before Aleem reached for the lock, as if she had been waiting behind it with a stopwatch. "Girl," she greeted, then corrected herself with the dignity of a woman who respects names. "Aoi."

Aoi bowed, hinge‑perfect. "Morning, Mdm Rahman. Thank you for seeing me. I brought--" She lifted a box. "Not pretty cake. Correct cake. And a new sponge. Because democracy."

His mother accepted the sponge like a blessing. "Correct," she said. "Come in. Wash hands. Today we do simple: omelette with diplomacy, soup as policy, and you slice spring onion like prayer. Aleem will be assistant. He will not narrate."

"Yes, Ma," Aleem said automatically, and Aoi echoed it with a grin that made his mother laugh with teeth.

They cooked as if they had always been a three-person committee. His mother ran the stove. Aleem chopped. Aoi washed vegetables with the patience of someone making peace with water. The kitchen smelled like ginger and the kind of affection that does not need to say its name.

Between tasks, his mother asked, "Tokyo okay?"

Aoi answered with nouns. "Work okay. Sleep learning. People kind. I have a drawer now for sentences and handkerchiefs. Aleem sent me those handkerchiefs. I fold them when I feel… too watched."

His mother nodded, approving of coping that doesn't audition. "Good. You fold; you don't break. If you break, you call. We clean. We eat kueh for victory."

Aoi's eyes brightened. "Correct break," she said, and the kitchen agreed.

***

After lunch, his mother did what mothers do when they approve: she gave them chores.

"Go buy coriander," she ordered. "And limes. And one packet of those fishballs you like, Aleem. I want to see if Aoi can choose fishballs without filming them."

Aoi saluted. "Public exam."

They went to the market down the street--small, neighborhood, the aunties gentler but no less exact. Aoi chose limes by smell. She chose coriander by stems. She asked the fishball uncle, politely, if today's batch was "honest." He laughed and gave her the good ones.

Aleem watched her navigate the auntie economy and felt, again, the particular tenderness of seeing someone you like be competent in a room that matters.

At the stall, the uncle asked with a grin, "Couple ah?"

Aoi answered first, steady. "We're buying coriander."

Aleem added, "And we're boring on purpose."

The uncle laughed, delighted, and handed them an extra lime as if bribing them to keep behaving.

***

That evening, Aleem met Aoi in the hotel lobby again. Same bench. Same visibility. Same small bows.

"Rules?" he asked.

"No photos," she recited. "Phones for time. Library closes at eleven. And…" She held up a small slip of paper. "I wrote something for your museum."

He took it with both hands.

*First visits are not fireworks.*  
*They are shelves learning new jars.*

He laughed softly, because she had learned his language and then returned it with her own handwriting.

They walked to the museum, weekday night, because they could be anonymous among stone. They sat on a bench in a dim gallery and let the room do the talking. Her shoulder brushed his once--accident, then a question.

"May I?" she whispered.

"Yes," he whispered.

She leaned her head to his shoulder for one count. He did not move. He let the bench of his body do its job.

They left the museum before closing. Outside, the city was still busy with people who believed in tomorrow's deadlines.

At the curb, she touched two fingers to her cheekbone--request. He mirrored, then tapped his desk in the air--caption.

"Later," he said.

"Later," she agreed, grateful, not disappointed.

Before she turned away, she lifted her palm, flat--two taps; one hold; three light taps. "Here," she said. "Stay. Air."

"Here," he answered. "Stay. Air."

***

Back home, he opened the locker door's paper museum and filed her slip under *Choose together.* Then he cut a new square from the corner of a calendar that had become a second language.

*First visits are shelves learning jars.*

He pressed it into place and felt the paper accept the house.

His phone chimed.

*A: Home. Thank you for market auntie economy and your mother's sponge approval. Tomorrow: one more ordinary day before I fly. We proceed by invitation.*

*Aleem: Proceed. Tomorrow: Botanic Gardens early + soup policy after. No fireworks. Just shelves.*

*A: Shelves.*

He put the phone face down and let the fan rehearse rain. The visit was not a climax. It was a proof-of-concept, and proof was not the goal.

The goal was a life that could be lived in lowercase.

Two in, hold, three out.

Respect. Distance. Gratitude.

And somewhere between a hotel lobby bench and a kitchen sponge, a home pantry learned that one more jar belonged there.
