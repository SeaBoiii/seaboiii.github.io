Aoi's last morning in Singapore started with the smallest good thing: the kettle working without argument.

Aleem didn't text her at dawn. That was part of the Charter now--**we don't collect each other's mornings like receipts.** He made his mother tea, wiped the stove because the stove loved to be wiped, and went for a short run that let East Coast air rinse his head.

At 9:14 a.m., her message arrived.

*A: Green. Packing. Lobby at 11:00. We do airport rules.*

*Aleem: Copy. No airport. I'll see you at hotel lobby. Lunch at Changi Village (public). Then you taxi. I'll go home.*

*A: Proceed. Thank you for being boring.*

He smiled into his water bottle like a man who had learned that boring can be a vow.

***

At 10:50 he sat on the hotel lobby bench that squeaked when people sat with honesty. Visible to staff. Visible to the cameras that pretend they don't exist. Nothing private about it except the way his chest counted.

Aoi came down with her tote and her carry‑on, cap on until she chose the room. When she did, she removed it, tucked it away, and exhaled like a person returning a borrowed weight.

"Morning," she said.

"Morning," he replied. "Rules?"

"No photos," she said. "Phones for time. Public first. We proceed by invitation."

He lifted his palm; she met it--two taps, one hold; three light taps. Here. Stay. Air.

"Changi Village," he said, standing. "We eat. We do not perform goodbye."

"Correct," she said. "Goodbyes are work."

***

The bus ride out to Changi held its familiar Singapore chorus--students half awake, uncles with earbuds leaking auntie ballads, a child counting lampposts as if numbers could protect him. They sat on the side seats where faces are least likely to become strangers' stories.

Aoi looked out at the highway and said softly, "I like this. Being… nothing."

"You're not nothing," he said.

She shook her head, smile small. "Nothing *public.* Just person. It's… restful."

"Rest is allowed," he echoed.

"Still," she said, and leaned her shoulder to his for one count--two in, hold, three out--then straightened, the most Singaporean form of affection: brief, correct, and committed.

***

Changi Village was loud in the way places are loud when they've been alive a long time. Fan blades did their endless ballet. Fried dough argued politely with sea air. Aleem chose a table near the wall where exit routes behaved.

They ordered without ceremony: nasi lemak, hot kopi, iced barley, one plate of goreng pisang because goodbye deserves sweetness but not drama.

Aoi ate with the neat economy of someone who had lived on schedules and now was practicing appetite as choice. She looked up mid‑bite and said, "May I ask something… for after?"

"Please."

"When I return to Tokyo, the noise will try to make me remember myself as a poster," she said. "If I slip--if I start writing too carefully, speaking too politely--will you remind me with one word?"

He didn't rush the answer. "Bench," he said.

She smiled. "Bench," she repeated, tasting the word like tea.

"And if I start trying to fix the ocean," he added, "you can say…"

"Toolbox," she answered immediately, delighted.

They let the language sit between them like a third cup.

"Now my question," Aleem said, and he kept his voice small enough for hawker aunties not to need to pretend not to listen. "Your schedule--first month back--how do we do us?"

Aoi wiped her mouth with a tissue like closing a file properly. "Mornings: green/amber. Nights: one word. Calls: once a week, fifteen minutes, timer. Visits: once every two months if it's kind. If it's not kind, we don't punish ourselves."

"Approved," he said.

"And…" She hesitated, then placed her palm flat on the table--two taps; one hold. Here. Stay. "If I need to cry, I will say peppermint. If I can't answer, I will say library closed. I will not disappear. I will rest."

His chest softened. "Thank you," he said, and meant *for letting the rule be love.*

They finished goreng pisang slowly, because slowness was one of the only luxuries that couldn't be bought.

***

Outside, the sea was doing its old job of pretending distance didn't exist. Planes rose in the far sky, lights like punctuation.

At the bus stop, they stood under the shelter as rain rehearsed in the distance. Aoi lifted her palm--two taps, one hold; three light taps. Here. Stay. Air.

He returned it. "Here. Stay. Air."

Then she touched two fingers to her cheekbone.

Request.

He mirrored, then tapped his own wrist--caption.

"May I?" she asked anyway, because words mattered more than signals.

"Yes," he said.

She leaned in and kissed him--soft, private, polite. One breath. Two in, hold, three out. She stepped back first.

"Okay?" she asked.

"Okay," he answered. "Thank you."

"After is care," she said, voice steady.

"After is care," he returned.

***

They did the goodbye the way they had learned to do everything: without stealing a room.

He walked her to the taxi stand at the edge of the village, not to the airport, not to a gate, not to a space where cameras hunt feelings. The driver loaded her bag with the competence of a man who had seen every kind of separation and knew most were ordinary.

Aoi turned once before getting in. "Aleem," she said, using his name like a choice, not a claim. "Thank you for first visit. For shelves. For sponges. For not being wind."

He kept his posture like furniture. "Thank you for coming in lowercase," he said. "For respecting my mother's stove religion. For being a person."

She smiled with her eyes. "Bench," she said.

"Bench," he answered.

The taxi took her toward the airport roads. He did not follow. He stood under the shelter until the taillights were gone and then turned toward the bus stop like a citizen.

***

That night, he sat at his desk with the step‑down post open again.

**Community Update -- Transition**

The cursor blinked like a small heartbeat. He thought of the past five years: row twelve, then row ten; the first banner, the first quiet bridge; the way his hands had learned to set tape lines on floors. He thought of Aoi's mouth on his cheekbone in candlelight, and how quickly he could ruin something good if he tried to carry too much.

He read the paragraph again--*not disappearing, lighter role, keep practices, keep kindness even when no one is watching.*

He heard his mother's voice: *Small and right is bigger than big and wrong.*

He heard Aoi's voice: *We are boring on purpose.*

He pressed **Send**.

No fireworks. No dramatic replies. Just a quiet thud in his chest and the relief of a chair pulled out from under a heavy box.

Within ten minutes, Zara replied first.

*Proud of you. I'll pin it and write a short "what it means" in grandma language. Go sleep.*

Kai followed.

*Bro you finally go be boyfriend full time. I will be mod uncle. Don't worry.*

The channel's replies were not a storm. Mostly hearts in lowercase. People saying thank you. A few anxious questions. A couple of dramatic paragraphs that Zara would gently move into DMs. The room behaved.

He didn't read all of it. He didn't need to. The point was never to be praised.

He stood, wiped the stove because rules glow in the dark, and opened the locker door's paper museum.

He added one new square cut from the corner of the calendar that had retired from months and become a source of small laws.

*Goodbyes are work. Do them kindly.*

He pressed it under *After is care* and above *Don't be the headline.*

His phone chimed.

*A: Home.*

He replied the one word back.

*Home.*

Then he put the phone face down and let the fan rehearse rain. Outside, buses kept their routes. Inside, a man had stepped down from a crowd without falling, and a girl six hundred kilometers away was unpacking in a Tokyo room that would learn new jars.

Two in, hold, three out.

Respect. Distance. Gratitude.

The first visit was over. The work of staying had begun.
