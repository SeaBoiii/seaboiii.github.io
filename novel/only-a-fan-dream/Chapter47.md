The storm had rinsed the city clean. Night hung warm and close over Toa Payoh, the corridor lamps turning the damp concrete a patient gold. Inside, Aleem’s room held a small circle of lamplight, the ceiling fan turning like a slow metronome. On the bedside table, the white crane watched them in profile.

Aoi stood by the bookshelf, trailing a fingertip along the spines as if reading the dust for tempo. Hair loose. Sweater sleeves pushed to her forearms. He could smell rain lifting from fabric, the faint sweetness of her shampoo. The window was cracked open; the block across the way breathed TV laughter that softened into the hour.

“May I come closer?” she asked.

“Yes,” he said, stepping back as if clearing stage space. “Please.”

They met in the middle, angle to angle, and let the quiet do its work. The first touch was simply palms finding each other. Then his thumbs mapping the small valley where her wrist pulse lived, steady and quick, asking with light pressure if she was here, if this was good.

“It is,” she said, reading the question. Her voice softened at the edges. “You can hold me.”

He gathered her with care, the way you carry something already in motion. Their bodies learned a line—the kind dancers keep when no one’s looking. She rested her forehead to his cheek and breathed in, counting four beats with him. When she lifted her head, the look in her eyes was both clear and undecorated.

“May I kiss you?” he asked.

“Please,” she said, and then they were close.

Heat arrived first—cheek to cheek, breath to breath—followed by the patience their months had earned. They kissed like they’d promised: slow, curious, stopping whenever one of them nudged a pause into the space. When her fingers slid to the back of his neck, she halted a breath short.

“This okay?” she asked.

“Yes,” he said, and the yes felt like stepping into light you chose.

They swayed a little without meaning to, the fan above giving them a quiet downbeat. Aoi’s hands found the clean line of his shoulders, then settled at the hem of his T-shirt, waiting. He nodded once. She lifted the fabric with unhurried care, like turning a page you wanted to understand. He did the same for her, checking again with a look, a breath, a yes answered by a yes.

Skin changed the conversation—warmer words, closer grammar. He traced the edge of her collarbone, and she hummed, a sound that lived in the throat and rolled gently toward his mouth. They kissed through that sound, through his name said on an exhale, through her laughter that arrived and stayed at the edge like a note she could return to.

“If at any point—” he began.

“I’ll say,” she finished, pressing her palm to his chest. “You too.”

He nodded. “Always.”

They moved together by consent and small adjustments: her drawing him toward the bed with the soft tug of two fingers; him dimming the lamp a fraction; both of them pausing when the corridor lift chimed and then letting the world outside fall away. Clothes became a trail of decisions, each one checked, each one answered. Heat gathered—along their arms, behind the knee, at the small of the back—ordinary places suddenly fluent.

When the moment leaned forward, he asked again, quieter.

“Okay?”

“Okay,” she said, and the word landed like a hand finding home.

The night turned steamy the way Singapore nights do—humidity turning skin to gloss, breath fogging the half-open window, the room’s small fan working without complaint. Their closeness learned depth without rush: mouths that tasted of rain and coffee; fingers that moved from map to memory; the hush that follows a mutual yes. When they needed to stop, they did. When they wanted to resume, they asked. In between, there were small laughs and the faint rhythm of someone playing music two floors down, filtered by concrete until it was just pulse.

They faded the light to a softer circle and let the rest of the evening belong to touch and listening. The details belonged to them, and to the quiet they kept for each other.

—fade—

After, the room cooled by degrees. Aoi lay on her side, hair tumbled across the pillow like a loose ribbon after a performance. Aleem propped himself on an elbow and watched for a moment, then risked a fingertip to trace a damp curl away from her temple.

“Water?” he asked.

“Please.”

He rose, careful of the mattress, and came back with two glasses beaded in the warm air. She drank, then pressed the cold circle to the inside of her wrist with a small, grateful sigh. He draped a thin cotton throw over both of them, then waited—not because he had to, but because waiting was part of how they were doing this.

“Are you okay?” he said, steady and plain.

She met his eyes. “I am. Are you?”

“I am.” He smiled, a little breathless still. “Thank you for telling me. For asking.”

“The asking is the dance,” she said, and some private relief eased her shoulders. She turned her hand palm-up between them. He fit his fingers into the offered shape.

They lay like that in the human silence that follows a storm—no thunder left, just the drip from high ledges, just the city settling into late. He felt the faint gallop of her pulse slow under his thumb, then match a new count. She shifted closer until their knees found the same line again, and the bed learned the weight of two.

“Aleem,” she said, voice a feather on the dark, “what do you need right now?”

“This,” he said. “Your hand. The room. The promise that we can say stop. Or start again.”

“Then we have it.” She squeezed once, a cue given and returned. After a soft minute: “Tomorrow—still the Gallery?”

“Yes.” He nuzzled her hairline and paused. “This okay?”

She smiled into the pillow. “It is.”

He kissed the spot where her pulse beat at the base of her throat, then settled. The white crane on the table caught a ribbon of light from the hall and seemed to lift its paper head toward them. Outside, a train slid through the night with the hush of distance, its sound arriving a heartbeat late through glass and damp.

“Keep the crane close,” Aoi murmured, already drowsy. “It reminds me to breathe between counts.”

He slid his free hand to the bedside and turned the little figure so its wings faced the bed. “It’ll keep time for us.”

The fan traced its slow circles. Their breathing matched again, not because they tried, but because the room had learned their quiet. Heat lingered sweetly in the air—the honest kind, the lived-in kind—and the city pressed its ear to their window, heard nothing it needed, and moved on. They let the night hold them that way: consent tucked into every small gesture, the promise of morning light on gallery floors, and the white crane keeping watch.
