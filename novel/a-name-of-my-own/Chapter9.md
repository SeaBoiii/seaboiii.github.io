### Chapter 9: Tension in the Air

The next morning, everything looked the same.

The same hallways. The same morning stretches. The same instructors barking instructions in clipped, tired voices. But for Xinyi, the air felt different. Charged.

She avoided Minjae all day.

Not out of regret--but out of fear that what had happened between them would be written across her face. That someone would see her smile differently. That her body would betray the spark that still burned just beneath her skin.

Every time she passed a security camera, she wondered if it had caught them. If the company knew. If their secret kiss now lived somewhere in the archives, waiting to ruin them.

Minjae, for his part, was quieter than usual in the office.

His coworkers barely noticed. He was always the calm one, the composed one. But inside, he was pacing. Thinking about the curve of her lips, the way she'd leaned in like she was asking for permission, not forgiveness.

He couldn't erase it. He didn't want to.

He'd kissed her.

And he'd do it again.

During practice, Xinyi caught a few of the other trainees whispering.

About what, she wasn't sure. But one girl glanced her way and quickly looked off.

She danced harder. Pushed herself. Told herself to stop shaking.

After practice, the vocal trainer pulled her aside. "You're tense today. Something going on?"

Xinyi smiled too fast. "Just tired."

The trainer didn't press.

But her gaze lingered a second too long.

That evening, a text buzzed on her phone.

[Minjae] -- Rooftop. Ten minutes. If it's okay.

Her thumb hovered over the screen. She didn't reply.

She just went.

The rooftop was quiet, lit by dim floodlights and the hum of the city below. He stood near the edge, arms folded, his coat drawn close.

"You came," he said.

"I shouldn't have."

"I know."

She stepped closer.

"I think people are starting to notice."

"I know," he said again.

She looked at him--really looked. "This can't be just a mistake. If we do this, it's not just about hiding. It's about surviving. You know what they'd do to me if they found out."

"I wouldn't let them," Minjae said, voice low. "If they make you choose between the stage and thisâ€¦ I'll make sure you never have to face that alone."

Xinyi swallowed.

"This isn't a fantasy," she whispered.

"I don't want a fantasy," he said. "I want you."

She hesitated. Then closed the space between them.

Not to kiss him again.

Just to stand beside him.

For now.
