We were in the kitchen, our hands tangled in something as simple as prepping spring onions and eggs. She leaned into my side with a quiet smile, her laughter muffled against my shoulder when I tried to show off a one-handed egg crack and failed miserably.

“Show-off,” she teased.

“Didn’t hear you complaining last night,” I said, just loud enough for her to elbow me.

We weren’t trying to be anything. We just were — easy, close, natural. Like the kiss had broken something open, and in its place, something softer had begun to grow. No longer guessing. No longer pretending.

She stood in front of the sink, rinsing greens, and I came up behind her, wrapping my arms loosely around her waist. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t freeze. Just leaned into me with a faint hum as I pressed a small kiss behind her ear, then another one just below it.

“You’re clingy today,” she murmured.

“I’m making up for lost time.”

She didn’t argue.

We were still in that moment — still laughing, still close — when the knock came at the door.

When I opened the door, Kim Ho stood there grinning, hoodie slung over his shoulder, a duffel bag hanging off one side.

"Surprise! Your favorite human has arrived."

I blinked. "You didn’t tell me you were coming."

“I know. That’s why it’s a surprise.”

He stepped inside like he owned the place, kicked off his shoes, and tossed his bag into the spare room before I could respond. It took me a second to realize how different the air had suddenly become — louder, less careful. The kind of noise we hadn’t had here in weeks.

Seo Yoon stepped out moments later. Her eyes widened.

“You’re here?”

Kim Ho turned. “Noona! I thought you’d moved out by now.”

She folded her arms. “This used to be my apartment first, remember?”

He looked between us, eyebrows raised. “Wait — you’re still staying here?”

She glanced at me, then back at him. “It’s close to work. Made sense to stay longer.”

He laughed, then pulled her into a brief hug. “You two haven’t killed each other yet?”

She smiled, but I caught the tightness in it. The glance she threw me. The unreadable silence tucked between us.

Dinner was chaos. Kim Ho was his usual self — loud, animated, full of stories. But beneath the laughter and chopsticks, the rhythm between me and Seo Yoon had shifted, and it was hard not to feel the difference.

Around Kim Ho, we were more careful. Still close, still warm — but quieter in our closeness. Where her hand would have rested on mine, it now lingered a second too long before retreating. Where I might have kissed her shoulder behind the privacy of the kitchen door, I only brushed past, offering a glance instead.

She moved around me with the same grace, still finishing my sentences, still tapping my ankle when I forgot the rice, but her smile was more restrained. Her eyes flicked to her brother more than once.

At one point, she reached for the ladle and I stepped in at the same time — our arms naturally overlapping like they had the night before. But then, she caught herself. Pulled back too quickly. And I watched her lips press into a line, as if she were trying to erase something.

Kim Ho kept talking, oblivious. “She cooks for you, hyung? Unbelievable. Miracles do exist.”

“She doesn’t just cook,” I replied. “She critiques my knife skills.”

“Because they’re tragic,” Seo Yoon added. She tried to keep her tone playful, but I heard the caution behind it.

Kim Ho raised an eyebrow. “You two are getting along weirdly well.”

I gave a shrug. “Maybe we’ve just figured each other out.”

Seo Yoon’s chopsticks paused. She looked at me briefly before murmuring, “Something like that.”

When our hands brushed again, this time over the banchan, she looked down quickly. No smirk. Just silence.

Kim Ho didn’t notice.

But I did.

And for the first time since the kiss, I realized: we hadn’t gone back to hiding — we were trying to pretend we’d never stopped.

And I wondered how long we could keep pretending that we hadn’t already crossed a line neither of us regretted.

That thought followed me through every smile I forced in front of Kim Ho, every joke I pretended to laugh at. It followed me when she handed me the rice paddle like nothing had changed, and when our hands brushed just a little too long while reaching for the same glass. We weren’t hiding out of shame — we were hiding out of fear. Fear of what it would cost to bring something fragile into the light.

—

After dinner, Kim Ho passed out early on the living room floor, sprawled across the heated blanket with a cushion under his arm. I cleaned up quietly. Seo Yoon helped dry the dishes, her fingers brushing mine once — and pausing.

This time, she didn’t pull away immediately.

We stood in the kitchen, just the two of us, elbows grazing, the weight of what hadn’t been said resting on the counter between us.

“This feels weird,” she said softly, her voice almost drowned by the sound of the water draining.

“He wasn’t supposed to show up.”

She shook her head. “I meant this. Us. Pretending nothing happened.”

I wiped my hands on the dish towel. “I didn’t think we were pretending.”

“Aren’t we?” she asked. “Around him?”

I looked at her. “What do you want to do?”

She leaned against the counter, her eyes steady now. “If we do this… we can’t keep hiding.”

I took a breath and stepped a little closer.

“Then I won’t hide.”

Her breath caught in her throat. Her eyes didn’t leave mine. And for a moment, we just stood there — two people no longer afraid to call this what it was.

Something real.

—

The next morning, Kim Ho rubbed his eyes at breakfast, yawning as he chewed on toast. Seo Yoon and I sat across from him, pretending to be more focused on our bowls than we really were.

“So, hyung,” he said mid-bite, tone too casual to be casual, “what’s going on with you two?”

I froze. Seo Yoon did too. Her spoon hovered halfway to her mouth.

“What do you mean?” I asked, trying to play it off.

He shrugged. “I don’t know. Just feels like… something’s weird. You’re different. Both of you.”

Seo Yoon looked down at her plate, lips pressed tight. I looked at him — really looked. The way his brows pinched. The way he wasn’t laughing.

He wasn’t joking. He knew something.

I put my spoon down.

“We kissed.”

The toast fell from his hand.

“What?”

“It wasn’t planned,” I said quickly. “It just… happened. We didn’t mean to keep it from you.”

He stared between us. “Are you serious?”

I nodded. “We didn’t plan this, Ho. But it wasn’t a mistake either.”

Seo Yoon finally looked up. Her voice was steady, but quiet. “It wasn’t his fault.”

Kim Ho’s face twisted — confusion giving way to something heavier. “But… you’re my hyung.”

“I know.”

“And you’re my sister.”

“I know,” she echoed. But her voice broke slightly on the second word.

He stood up abruptly, chair scraping the floor. He paced once across the room, then turned back.

“So what now? You’re dating?”

“No,” I said. “We’re figuring it out. Carefully. But I didn’t want to lie to you anymore.”

His eyes locked on mine, hurt flickering beneath the anger. “You should’ve told me the moment it meant something.”

“I didn’t know how,” I said. “I was scared of losing you.”

He was quiet for a moment.

“Too late,” he said.

Then he grabbed his jacket, shoved his phone into his pocket, and stepped toward the door. For a second, I thought he might say something more — might throw one last jab, or ask why, or say he hated me.

But he just looked at me. Then at her.

His expression wasn’t angry anymore. Just hurt. And that was worse.

“Take care of her,” he said. Not a blessing. Not approval. Just a line drawn.

He opened the door and stepped out. The door didn’t slam. It clicked shut — quiet, careful, final.

But it echoed all the same.

And the silence he left behind didn’t ask for room.

It filled everything.

This one stayed.
