In the days that followed, the air between us shifted again — not tense, just measured. Like we were relearning how to exist around each other without brushing against whatever was quietly growing in the dark.

We still ate together. Still passed each other mugs, shared the same couch, stood side by side in the kitchen. But there was a difference now — a breath more space between our chairs, a hesitation before our hands reached for the same dish.

She came home later most nights. I told myself it was just work. I never asked.

One evening, as the sun dipped behind the skyline, I brought a junior over from class. A girl named Hana who had been struggling with algorithm design. She had texted me earlier in the week: can I swing by to go over the slides? And I said yes without thinking much of it.

We sat at the table, laptops open, sketches of pseudocode between us. She was bright, quick-witted, a little flirty in the way some students are when they’re trying to charm their way through a lesson. I smiled politely and kept it professional.

Then Seo Yoon came home.

The door clicked open, and she stepped in, pausing when she saw us.

“Oh,” she said. “You have a guest.”

“Just tutoring,” I said quickly. “She had questions about class.”

Hana stood and bowed politely. Seo Yoon returned the gesture with a tight-lipped smile and disappeared into her room without another word.

When Hana left twenty minutes later, I cleared the table in silence, unsure whether I should knock on her door.

I didn’t have to.

She came out before I could decide.

“You should’ve told me someone was coming over,” she said. Her voice wasn’t sharp — just cool.

“I didn’t think it mattered,” I replied. “It was just tutoring.”

She nodded once, but didn’t move.

Then, softer: “I just thought… we had something better than that kind of mess.”

I stared at her.

“Mess?”

She folded her arms. “Not her. Just… the energy. I don’t know. It felt like noise. We don’t do noise.”

I stared at her, the heat rising fast. "How about you?"

She blinked.

I took a step forward. "I saw you, you know. That night with your team. You looked comfortable enough then — smiling when that guy drank for you. Letting him put a hand on your back like he knew you. Like he had the right to guide you."

Her arms lowered slightly. Her expression flickered — surprised, then something more raw. Hurt, maybe. Or guilt.

"So don't talk to me about mess," I said, voice quieter now. "Because I was the one who brought you home that night. I was the one who stayed up boiling soup. Not him."

She inhaled sharply. "I didn’t ask you to."

I froze.

She seemed to regret it the moment the words left her mouth. Her shoulders tensed, and she looked down, as if trying to take it back without actually saying it.

Then, softer: "But I know you did. And I... didn’t know how to talk about that either."

She didn’t wait for a reply. She turned and walked to her room, her movements slower now.

The words stayed between us, heavy and unfinished.

I stood there for a long time, fists clenched against the edge of the table. The words still hung in the air, sharp and unfinished.

That night, she didn’t come out for dinner. I didn’t knock.

—

Much later, I sat by the window, the city glowing faintly below. My glass of water sweated against my palm. The apartment was quiet again. Not peacefully so. Just… waiting. Like it was listening.

I didn’t hear her approach until she was there — standing just behind me, hesitant. Then she sat down, folding her legs beneath her, not too close, not too far.

Neither of us spoke at first.

The light outside flickered against the glass. Inside, the distance we’d pulled taut was still hanging, stretched between us.

“I’m sorry,” she said quietly, without looking at me. “For what I said earlier.”

I stayed silent. Not out of anger, but because I wasn’t sure I could trust my voice.

“I didn’t mean it like that,” she added. “I just... didn’t know what to do with what I was feeling.”

The vulnerability in her tone softened something in me. But I didn’t say I forgave her. I didn’t say she was right or wrong.

Instead, I shifted slightly. And in the quiet that followed, she leaned her head against my shoulder — gently, like asking a question.

This time, I didn’t hesitate.

I let her stay there.

We didn’t speak. Didn’t move. Just sat, watching the city flicker beneath us.

And in that stillness, something settled between us.

Not resolved. Not broken.

But understood.
