Title: Orientation Week Weather
novel: under-the-same-umbrella
order: 1
---

The first rain of the afternoon arrived the way Singapore always did it--without warning, without apology, like the sky had been holding its breath all day and finally decided to exhale.

Rafi Tan heard it before he saw it.

A faint hiss against glass. The soft thrum of droplets gathering into a sheet. A chorus of startled voices outside the Glass Atrium as the air-conditioned calm of Stamford University met the sudden, wet heat of the street.

He didn't look up at first. He didn't have to. Rain was an old rhythm here--something you learned to live around, not through. You packed for it. You planned for it. You kept a spare umbrella in your bag, because being caught unprepared was a kind of stupidity Rafi couldn't afford.

A volunteer from the Orientation Committee stepped into his line of sight with a tray of lanyards and neon wristbands.

"Hi! Hello! Welcome to Stamford!" she chirped, like her voice was being powered by the same fluorescent lights overhead. "Are you joining as a buddy? Student mentor? International liaison?"

Rafi blinked once, slowly. The lanyards were bright enough to offend his eyes.

"No," he said.

The girl paused as if the word had short-circuited her script. "Oh--then are you… lost?"

"I'm a student," he replied. His tone stayed even. Neutral. "Fourth year."

Her gaze flicked down to his clean shirt, the backpack slung over one shoulder, the way he stood half a step outside the crowd as if he was allergic to being touched. "Then… are you helping with something?"

Rafi didn't smile. It wasn't a refusal, not exactly. Smiles, in his experience, invited follow-up questions.

"I'm just passing through."

She recovered. "Okay! Enjoy the fair!"

As she disappeared into the noise, Rafi let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.

Orientation Week had always looked like this from the outside--bright banners, booths covered in balloons, student leaders shouting into microphones with the kind of enthusiasm that felt slightly suspicious. Today, the Glass Atrium was a fish tank full of people pretending they weren't nervous. International students drifted in clusters, clutching printed maps and translucent folders. Local freshmen hovered at the edges with the quiet terror of people who had just realized adulthood came without instructions.

Rafi moved with purpose, but not urgency. He wasn't running from the crowd. He was navigating it like a system: identify the safest path, minimize friction, keep moving.

His phone buzzed.

A calendar reminder flashed across the screen:

**SADRO Briefing -- 3:00 PM**

SADRO.

Stamford Advancement & Donor Relations Office.

The name alone made his shoulders tighten.

He slipped his phone back into his pocket and adjusted the strap of his backpack, fingers brushing the handle of the umbrella tucked inside. The familiar weight steadied him.

Rafi wasn't scared of donors. He wasn't scared of interviews. He wasn't scared of people.

He was scared of the one thing that didn't follow rules.

Perception.

***

Across the Atrium, Mika Nakamura stood very still.

Not because she wasn't moving--she was. She nodded politely as a student ambassador explained Stamford's club system with a practiced smile. She accepted a flyer she didn't want. She murmured "thank you" in the soft, measured English she had perfected over years of being the kind of Japanese daughter who didn't cause trouble.

But inside, her body felt like a taut string.

She could still feel the heat of her phone against her palm from the call that had ended only minutes ago.

"Mika," her mother had said, careful as always. "How long are you going to stay there?"

In the background, there had been the muted clink of ceramic cups, the sound of a house that smelled like tatami and obligation.

"I told you," Mika had answered, voice light. "Until the semester ends. My scholarship--"

Her father's voice had cut in. "Enough. You are not a child. We have been patient."

Mika's spine had stiffened.

Patient.

As if her life in Singapore was a hobby they were allowing her to indulge.

"There is talk," her father continued, and Mika could hear the weight of the word travel through the phone line. "You are alone there. You are stressed. You are… unstable."

Unstable.

A label that stuck.

"We arranged an introduction," her mother said quickly, as if softening the blade. "Only a meeting. It's normal. Many girls do this. You can come home after your exams."

Mika had stared at the rain-smeared campus through the Atrium glass and felt something in her chest tighten until it became pain.

"I'm fine," she said, and hated how small her voice sounded.

Her father exhaled, the kind of exhale that wasn't tired but disappointed. "If you were fine, you would not be there alone."

Mika swallowed.

She could have said a thousand things.

She could have said: I have friends.

She could have said: I am building a future.

She could have said: I chose this.

But the truth was, there were moments--quiet moments, late at night in Bayview Residences when the air-conditioning hummed and her roommate slept--that she felt the loneliness settle on her like humidity.

And her parents could smell it from across the sea.

So she did what she always did.

She smiled, even though they couldn't see it.

"I'm fine," she repeated. "I'm safe."

"We will talk again," her father said.

Then the line went dead.

Now, in the Glass Atrium, Mika held herself like a person who refused to be seen cracking.

She adjusted the strap of her tote bag. She tucked her hair behind her ear. She looked at the booth for the International Students Association--bright posters, cheerful photos, the promise of community.

She wondered what it felt like to be the kind of person who had someone.

Not a friend.

Not a roommate.

Someone.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Haruka:

**Are you at the fair? I'm coming.**

Mika stared at the words.

Haruka Satō. Japanese Society President. International Business major. Perfect smile. Perfect grades. Perfect life.

Haruka meant well.

Haruka also represented everything Mika's parents wanted for her.

Mika typed back:

**Yes. I'm here.**

Then she added, after a second:

**I might need your help.**

She hovered over send. Her thumb trembled.

She deleted the second sentence.

Instead, she sent a sticker of a small cartoon cat holding an umbrella.

It was a joke.

A harmless little thing.

But as Mika's eyes lifted, she saw the rain outside thickening, and the joke felt like a prophecy.

***

Rafi's briefing was in Rutherford Hall, a building that always felt one degree colder than it needed to.

The SADRO office smelled faintly of lemon-scented cleaner and expensive paper. The walls were lined with framed photographs--handshakes, gala dinners, men in suits smiling beside oversized donation cheques.

Rafi sat at the edge of the meeting room table, posture straight. He kept his hands folded loosely in front of him, the way he'd learned to do in interviews. Calm, attentive, unthreatening.

Dr. Elaine Koh arrived ten minutes late, which in itself was a test.

She entered like she belonged to the building: quiet heels, neat blazer, hair pulled back in a way that suggested she didn't waste time on things that didn't matter.

Her eyes swept the room, found Rafi, and held there for half a second longer than necessary.

"Rafael Tan," she said.

"Yes, Dr. Koh."

She nodded as if confirming something.

The other students in the room were younger, louder, more visibly eager. Dr. Koh spoke to everyone, but her attention kept returning to Rafi the way a magnet returned to its pair.

"The Rutherford-Lee Leadership Grant is not just money," she said, voice smooth. "It is access. Mentorship. Network. Doors that do not open twice."

Rafi listened.

He already knew.

His stomach tightened anyway.

"The committee is meeting candidates early this year," Dr. Koh continued. "We are looking at academic performance, leadership involvement, and--"

She paused.

Then, casually, she added: "--stability."

The word landed like a stone dropped into water.

Rafi's jaw clenched.

He knew what she meant. Everyone did. The committee didn't just fund talent. They funded stories. They liked people who looked like they had their life under control.

Dr. Koh clicked her remote. A slide appeared: **DONOR NETWORKING DINNER -- RSVP REQUIRED**

"This dinner is not optional," she said. "You will be there. You will be presentable. You will be… convincing."

Convincing.

Rafi's mind flickered, unwillingly, to the memory he had been trying to bury since last semester: the campus event, the music too loud, the crowd too close, Chloe's voice sharp as glass.

"You didn't even tell me," she'd hissed, fingers digging into his arm. "So that's it? You just move on like I never mattered?"

It had happened in public.

That was what made it dangerous.

There had been a photo.

Someone had posted it.

**StamfordSpills** had done what it always did: turned a moment into a narrative.

Rafi had learned, painfully, that being right wasn't enough if people had already decided what they saw.

Dr. Koh's gaze met his.

"Rafael," she said, softly now, as if speaking directly to him without admitting it. "I trust you understand."

Rafi nodded. "Yes."

He wanted to add: I have no intention of embarrassing myself again.

But that sounded like fear.

So he said nothing.

When the briefing ended, he left Rutherford Hall with his jaw tight and his umbrella heavier in his bag than it had any right to be.

The sky outside had darkened.

Rain blurred the campus into a watercolor.

Rafi walked faster.

***

The Glass Atrium was louder now.

Freshmen shouted over each other. Club recruiters waved flyers like weapons. Someone's portable speaker crackled with K-pop. The air smelled of sweat, perfume, and cheap iced coffee.

Rafi kept his head down as he cut through the crowd. He wasn't here to socialize. He was here to get back to Bayview, to review the incident-response case study he'd been given for the NCSB pre-screening, to do anything that felt controllable.

And then, like the universe had a sense of humour, he saw her.

Chloe Lim.

She stood near the Cultural Night booth, laughing at something a sponsor liaison had said. Her hair was perfectly styled, her lipstick immaculate, her smile bright in a way that made people lean in. She wore a fitted blouse and carried herself like she was already employed somewhere with glass offices.

Rafi's chest tightened.

He didn't hate Chloe.

He hated what being near her did to his nervous system.

It made him hyper-aware. Defensive. Ready to be misunderstood.

He altered his path immediately--small shift, casual enough that no one would notice.

But Chloe's eyes found him anyway.

They always did.

For a heartbeat, her smile faltered.

Then it returned, sharper.

"Rafi," she called.

He stopped because running would look guilty.

He turned.

"Hi."

Chloe walked toward him, expression softening into something that might have been friendly if you didn't know how easily she could weaponize friendliness.

"Didn't expect to see you here," she said.

"It's campus," he replied.

"Mm." Her gaze flicked over him--the backpack, the crisp shirt, the faint tension in his shoulders. "You look… busy."

"I am."

Chloe's smile widened as if she liked that answer.

"I saw the SADRO email," she said lightly. "Donor dinner. Congrats. You're still on the list."

Rafi's eyes narrowed. "How did you--"

Chloe tilted her head. "I'm Partnerships Lead, remember? I see things."

She stepped closer.

The crowd noise blurred.

Rafi could smell her perfume--something floral and expensive. It made his stomach twist.

"You should be careful," Chloe murmured, tone gentle like advice. "People are watching you again. Especially this year."

Again.

The word hit a nerve.

Rafi kept his face blank. "Thanks."

Chloe's eyes glittered. "Anytime."

She leaned in, as if she might kiss his cheek in front of everyone. Rafi stiffened instinctively.

Chloe paused--just a fraction.

Then she smiled as if she'd confirmed something.

The humiliation was subtle, the way a bruise formed under skin without visible injury.

Rafi took a step back.

"Excuse me," he said.

Chloe's smile didn't drop, but her gaze hardened. "Sure."

Rafi turned away before she could say more.

He didn't see the phone lifted by a freshman nearby.

He didn't see the lens catching the exact angle: Chloe leaning in, Rafi stepping back, his expression unreadable.

He didn't see the moment becoming content.

Because he was already moving.

Because he was already trying to outrun perception.

***

Mika saw the entire thing.

Not because she was spying.

Because Haruka had arrived, and Haruka had tugged her toward the Cultural Night booth to "say hello properly," and because Mika's timing was always unlucky.

Haruka linked her arm through Mika's with familiar ease.

"Mika-chan! You didn't tell me you're volunteering for ISA!"

"I'm not volunteering," Mika said, keeping her smile polite. "I was just looking."

Haruka laughed. "You should. It's good for networking. Also, your parents will like it."

Mika's smile tightened.

Then she noticed the man.

He wasn't tall in a striking way, but he had presence--not loud, not flashy. The kind of presence that came from stillness. His hair was neatly cut. His posture was straight. His eyes were tired in a way Mika recognized: not sleepy tired, but tired of managing.

He was walking away from a pretty girl who looked like she had never lost an argument.

Mika watched the girl's face change--sweetness sharpening into something else.

Haruka followed her gaze.

"Oh," Haruka said, casually. "That's Rafael Tan. Computer Engineering. Cyber Defense Society VP. Very capable."

Mika blinked. "You know him?"

"Everyone knows him," Haruka said with a shrug, as if competence was gossip. "He's… quiet. But reliable. That girl is Chloe Lim. They dated, I think. It ended badly."

Mika's stomach tightened.

Badly.

She didn't know why the word resonated.

She watched Rafael--Rafi--disappear into the crowd, shoulders tense like he was trying not to be touched.

Something in her chest shifted.

Rafi looked like someone who understood what it meant to be watched.

Mika's phone buzzed again.

A message from her mother this time.

**Are you safe?**

The question should have been simple.

It felt like a net.

Mika stared at the words.

She could reply: Yes.

She could reply: I'm fine.

She could reply: Please trust me.

But trust wasn't a language her parents spoke easily.

They spoke proof.

They spoke stability.

They spoke: show us.

Mika's gaze returned to the crowd.

To Rafi's disappearing figure.

To the way he had stepped back from Chloe not like fear--but like boundaries.

A ridiculous thought formed in her mind.

Then another.

Then a line connected them.

Mika's heart beat once, hard.

She turned to Haruka with a smile that felt too bright.

"I'm going to… get a drink," she said.

Haruka blinked. "Now? I just arrived--"

"I'll be back," Mika promised.

She slipped away before Haruka could follow.

She moved through the crowd with purpose she hadn't felt in weeks.

Rafi was harder to find now, swallowed by bodies and booths. Mika scanned faces, ignoring the way her palms were sweating.

There.

She spotted him near the edge of the Atrium, close to the glass doors leading outside. He stood with his phone in hand, jaw tight, thumb hovering over the screen as if deciding whether to respond to something.

For a second, Mika hesitated.

She had never been the kind of person who asked strangers for help.

But she wasn't asking for help.

She was offering a solution.

A clean one.

A mutually beneficial lie.

Mika stepped closer.

Before she could lose her nerve, she said, softly:

"Rafael Tan?"

He looked up.

His eyes met hers.

They were dark, steady, guarded.

Mika felt her throat tighten.

Up close, he looked even more tired.

He didn't smile. He didn't frown.

He simply watched her, as if assessing whether she was a threat.

"Yes?"

Mika swallowed. "I'm sorry. I know this is strange. We… we don't know each other."

Rafi's gaze flicked to her lanyard. International student. Japanese Society wristband. The way she held herself--polite, controlled, but braced.

His expression didn't change, but his attention sharpened.

Mika took a breath.

Outside, the rain intensified, hammering the glass.

Inside, the Atrium felt too bright, too loud, too exposed.

Mika forced herself to hold his gaze.

Then she said the first honest thing she'd said all day.

"I need to look… stable," she whispered.

Rafi's eyes narrowed. "Stable?"

Mika's lips parted. She could feel her pulse in her throat.

She could still back out.

She could laugh and say she misspoke.

She didn't.

"My parents," she said, voice steadying as if once the truth began, it demanded to be finished. "They're trying to bring me back to Japan. They think I'm alone here."

Rafi stared at her.

Mika kept going, because stopping would mean admitting she was desperate.

"And you," she added, the words surprising even her. "You looked like you were trying not to be misunderstood."

A flicker.

Something moved behind Rafi's eyes. Not emotion. Recognition.

Mika's fingers tightened around her tote strap.

"I don't know you," she repeated. "But I think you… you might be the kind of person people believe."

Rafi's jaw flexed.

He glanced past her shoulder.

Mika followed his gaze.

Chloe stood across the Atrium, watching.

Her expression was unreadable now, but her eyes were bright in a way that suggested interest.

Rafi looked back at Mika.

His voice was low when he spoke.

"What are you asking?"

Mika's heart pounded.

She could feel the ridiculousness of it--asking a near-stranger to become part of her life's most fragile negotiation.

But the rain outside was relentless.

And inside her chest, something was already breaking.

So she lifted her chin.

She held his gaze.

And she said, very quietly:

"Can I borrow you… for something?"

Rafi didn't answer immediately.

He simply looked at her, as if measuring the risk.

As if weighing the cost of being seen beside her.

As if deciding whether lending himself was another kind of umbrella.

Outside, the rain continued.

Inside, Mika waited.

And somewhere in the crowd, a phone camera caught the two of them standing too close to the glass--two strangers framed by stormlight--like the beginning of a story the internet would write for them first.
