### **Chapter 25: Of Weddings and What-Ifs**

The invitation arrived on a rainy Monday.

An envelope with gold lettering, addressed to “ABIX (plus ones welcome!)” — and inside, the familiar name of someone they hadn’t spoken to in years.

**Jolene Tan & Mark Ong.**

Ex-Badminton Club President. Former Year 2 Orientation Coordinator. Practically a living NTU mascot back then.

“I didn’t even know they were dating,” Crystal muttered, staring at the invite over coffee.

“Apparently since 2018,” Ivan said, flipping it like it was a crossword puzzle. “Guess some things do go on behind the scenes.”

“I think they started during that Beach Fiesta camp,” Isabelle offered. “We were all too busy trying not to sunburn.”

Aleem said nothing. Just read the invite once and tucked it neatly back into its envelope.

The wedding was set for early November. A garden venue. Evening reception. Formal attire.

The group RSVP’d without hesitation.

They didn’t know it yet, but this would be one of those events—where nothing groundbreaking happened, and yet... everything changed.

#### **The Garden, The Suits, The Silence**

The venue was beautiful. Predictably curated. Fairy lights strung through banyan trees. Mason jars with baby’s breath. Soft jazz playing from hidden speakers.

Ivan arrived with his long-time girlfriend, Amanda. They moved as if molded from the same rhythm—quiet familiarity, gentle sarcasm. You could tell they’d been together since school. Their love wasn’t performative. It was practiced. Understood.

Crystal came with her boyfriend, Zhi Kai—newer, more playful. She introduced him with bright eyes and a warning grin. “Don’t let his face fool you—he’s terrible at badminton.”

Isabelle’s partner, Daniel, was quieter. Reserved, sweet. He stood just behind her, never imposing, always attentive. The kind of person who remembered how many sugars you liked in your drink.

Aleem came alone.

He said it was easier that way.

No explanations. No expectations.

He smiled when he saw the others, hugged them all, joked about Ivan finally wearing something besides a polo tee.

But part of him felt like a bystander.

And in a way, he was.

#### **Reunions & Realisations**

University reunions are strange.

You see faces that once filled your everyday life—now aged, polished, slightly more tired, slightly more sure. You smile politely. You ask the same five questions. You wonder who remembers what you looked like when you were figuring things out.

ABIX stuck close, as always. But the room tugged at them—old group mates, ex-CCAs, once-close lab partners. It was unavoidable.

“I ran into that guy from CN3131,” Isabelle whispered to Crystal. “Still can’t remember his name. Called him ‘Bro’ three times.”

Ivan returned from a chat with some old coursemates. “They’re all married. With kids.”

“You panicking?” Crystal teased.

“No. Just... recalibrating.”

Aleem sat on a bench nearby, nursing a drink, watching the dance floor begin to flicker to life. He wasn’t sad. Not quite. But something pressed lightly against his chest.

Everyone around him was building *with* someone.

He was still... somewhere else.

#### **The What-If Table**

During dinner, the four of them sat together again. Plates half-cleared. Laughter lingering.

And then, for no reason at all, Crystal asked:

“What’s something you once thought would happen... but didn’t?”

Ivan blinked. “You’re not drunk, are you?”

She smiled. “Just... indulge me.”

Isabelle was the first to answer. “I thought I’d end up being a pharmacist.”

“Too much organic chem?” Ivan smirked.

“Too much everything.”

Ivan said, “I thought I’d go overseas for good. Turns out, I missed home too much.”

Crystal looked at her wine. “I thought I’d end up alone.”

They all turned to her, surprised.

“I was always the loud one. The ‘fun’ one. People don’t always stay for fun.”

Aleem didn’t answer.

They didn’t ask.

Because they already knew.

#### **The End of the Night**

When the final song played and the couple shared their first dance, the group sat quietly beneath the fairy lights. Full. Tired. Changed.

Aleem watched the dance floor. Watched Ivan gently resting a hand on Amanda’s back. Watched Isabelle leaning into Daniel’s shoulder. Watched Zhi Kai making Crystal laugh in that specific way only he could.

And for the first time, he didn’t feel alone.

Just... in a different place.

His chapter wasn’t late.

It was unfolding at its own pace.

And his people?

They were still here.
