Nadia arrived early on purpose.

It was a habit disguised as preference, the kind that looked like "I like to be prepared" when the truth was closer to: *I like to control what I can, because the rest of life has a way of reaching into me without asking.*

The Grab dropped her at the resort entrance just after noon, when the sun stood high and unforgiving and the air smelled faintly of salt and polished stone. The driveway curved neatly past manicured hedges and a fountain that looked like it had been designed to photograph well from every angle.

Wedding places were always like this--beautiful in a way that demanded you be beautiful back.

Nadia paid, thanked the driver, and stepped out with her tote on one shoulder and her small suitcase rolling behind her. The wheels clicked over the stone path. Her sandals made soft, controlled sounds, the kind that didn't announce panic.

Inside the lobby, the air-conditioning wrapped around her skin like relief. It smelled of citrus diffuser and expensive wood. A pianist played something light near the lounge, each note scattering gently across the marble floor.

She kept her expression neutral as she crossed toward the reception.

Her phone buzzed.

**Brennan:** NADIAAA you reach already? 🙌🙌🙌 I'm trapped in rehearsal hell. Don't let the aunties bully you okay 😂

Nadia smiled despite herself, small and brief.

**Nadia:** I just reached. I'll check in.

**Brennan:** Good girl. Your room key under your name. Also later we got a small thing at 6pm. Don't disappear.

She typed **Okay** and slipped the phone into her bag.

The word *Okay* had become her favorite in the last few years. It was a bridge and a wall at the same time. It kept conversations smooth without letting anyone see too deep.

She reached the reception desk, gave her name, and waited as the staff clicked through a screen. The receptionist asked about her stay, offered a welcome drink, smiled professionally.

Nadia responded the way she always did--calm, polite, almost warm.

She could do warm.

She just didn't do vulnerable.

When the staff handed her keycard in a sleek envelope, Nadia thanked her and turned toward the elevators.

And then she felt it.

Not a sound.

Not a movement.

Just… a shift.

As if her body had sensed a familiar gravity somewhere in the building.

She slowed.

The lobby was full of people, a mixture of guests and staff and weekend tourists. Luggage rolled. A child squealed near the lounge chairs. Someone laughed too loudly. Glasses clinked.

Yet Nadia's attention narrowed until the entire place felt like it had been dimmed.

She turned slightly, pretending to glance at the signage near the lounge.

And saw him.

Rai.

Not up close.

Not directly.

He was across the lobby near the concierge desk, half turned away, wearing a dark shirt that fit him the way clean lines fit architecture--quietly, with intention. He had a small bag slung over one shoulder, and he stood with a stillness that made the people around him look like they were moving too fast.

His hair was a little longer than she remembered, the fringe brushing his forehead. His jawline looked sharper, not because he had changed drastically, but because time had a way of chiseling away softness.

Nadia's hand tightened on her suitcase handle.

Her breath caught so slightly she didn't think anyone would notice.

But her body noticed.

Her body always noticed him.

Even when she had tried to retrain it.

Even when she had told herself the ache was just old muscle memory, not meaning.

She stood there for a heartbeat too long.

Rai didn't see her.

Yet.

He was speaking to someone--maybe staff, maybe another guest--his head tilted slightly as he listened. Nadia watched his posture, the way his shoulders stayed squared even in casual conversation, as if his default state was prepared.

Prepared for what?

For work.

For responsibility.

For carrying.

Nadia's throat tightened.

She had promised herself she wouldn't do this.

She had promised herself she would arrive, smile, celebrate Brennan, and leave without reopening old rooms.

She had promised herself she was healed.

And yet, standing there with her keycard envelope in her hand, all she could think was: *He's real.*

Not a memory.

Not a phantom.

Not a face that surfaced when she was tired and alone.

Real.

Her instinct was to turn and walk away.

But the elevators were behind him.

The resort wasn't big, not really. Even if she avoided the lobby now, she would see him later.

Dinner.

Rehearsal.

Photos.

She could already imagine it--someone calling his name across a room, someone tugging him closer, the inevitable collision.

Her chest tightened again.

So she did the only thing she could do.

She moved.

Not toward him.

Not away.

Just forward, as if she belonged to her own life.

Her sandals tapped softly against marble. She rolled her suitcase toward the elevator bank. Her gaze stayed forward, fixed on the polished metal doors like they were something neutral.

When she reached the lift lobby, she pressed the button and waited.

The elevator dinged.

The doors slid open.

Two older aunties stepped out, perfume and floral prints and bright chatter. One of them glanced at Nadia and smiled.

"Wah, girl, you here for wedding ah? So pretty."

Nadia smiled politely. "Yes, aunty."

The aunties walked off.

Nadia stepped into the lift.

The mirrored wall caught her reflection--hair neatly tied, simple earrings, a light makeup look she had applied carefully because she knew there would be cameras.

She looked composed.

She looked like someone who had her life together.

She looked like a woman who had left her first love behind.

The elevator doors began to close.

And then, in the narrowing gap, she saw Rai turn.

As if some invisible thread had tugged him too.

His eyes lifted.

And for the briefest moment, their gaze met through the shrinking slit of light.

It was not dramatic.

No one gasped.

No music swelled.

But Nadia's heart did something sharp.

Because his expression changed in an instant.

Not into anger.

Not into warmth.

Just… recognition.

Like he had been living in a room with the lights off, and suddenly someone had flicked the switch.

His eyes held hers.

Then the elevator doors slid shut.

Nadia exhaled like she had been holding her breath underwater.

The lift rose smoothly, quiet as a confession.

She leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes.

The air-conditioning in the elevator was too cold.

Or maybe it was her.

She opened her eyes again.

Her fingers trembled slightly around the suitcase handle.

She forced them to still.

She was not going to unravel in an elevator.

She was not.

The floor number blinked upward.

When the lift reached her level, Nadia stepped out quickly, as if speed could outpace memory.

Her room was at the end of the corridor.

The hallway smelled like fresh linen and carpet cleaner, quiet and muffled. The world here felt far from the lobby and its shining cruelty.

Nadia walked, each step measured.

She stopped at her door, tapped the keycard, and entered.

The room was bright, the curtains open to a view of green lawn and a slice of sea beyond. Sunlight flooded the bedspread. The air smelled like hotel soap--clean, temporary.

Nadia set her suitcase down, kicked off her sandals, and stood still.

Her chest felt tight.

Her palms were cold.

She walked to the window and stared at the view.

It was beautiful.

But her mind was still in the lobby, stuck in that thin moment of eye contact.

She remembered his eyes.

How steady they had been.

How they had held something unsaid.

As if he had been about to speak.

As if he had been about to do something.

She swallowed.

It had been three years.

Three years of distance.

Three years of telling herself she did not need closure.

Three years of rebuilding routines and friendships and competence.

Three years of dating people who felt safe because they didn't touch the places Rai had touched.

Three years of telling herself, *You left for a reason.*

And she had.

She had left because she had been tired of knocking.

Tired of trying to love someone who kept his pain locked behind discipline and politeness.

Tired of feeling like she was reaching for him through glass.

She had left because she had been afraid that if she stayed, she would disappear.

But she had not left because she stopped loving him.

That was the part she never admitted.

Nadia pressed her forehead against the cool window.

Outside, palm leaves shifted in the breeze.

The sea glinted.

Everything looked calm.

Her phone buzzed again.

A new message.

Not Brennan.

A number she knew by heart even though she had deleted it from her favorites.

**Rai:** You're here.

Nadia's breath hitched.

One line.

Two words.

Yet it felt like a door opening.

Her fingers hovered over the screen.

She could ignore it.

She could pretend she didn't see.

She could wait until dinner and let the reunion happen in public, safer because there would be witnesses.

But she stared at the message until the letters blurred.

Her mind flashed with the last time he had texted her.

*Let me know when you're home.*

And her reply.

*I'm safe. Don't worry.*

Then nothing.

Silence.

Now, a new line.

*You're here.*

Not a greeting.

Not a question.

A statement.

As if he needed to confirm the reality.

Nadia swallowed.

Her thumbs moved.

**Nadia:** Hi.

She stared at her own reply.

Too small.

Too polite.

Too safe.

She could feel her heart beating fast, ridiculous for someone who had told herself she was done with this.

The typing bubble appeared.

Then stopped.

Then appeared again.

Nadia held her breath.

A message came.

**Rai:** Brennan put us at the same table.

Nadia's chest tightened.

Of course he knew.

Of course he looked.

Of course it mattered.

She typed:

**Nadia:** I saw.

Then she added, before she could stop herself:

**Nadia:** We can be normal.

The words looked naive the moment she sent them.

Normal.

As if love could be folded away like a dress.

The typing bubble appeared.

Longer this time.

Then his reply came.

**Rai:** Okay.

Just one word.

But Nadia could hear the weight behind it.

Not agreement.

Not reassurance.

A wall.

Her stomach sank.

She stared at the screen.

She shouldn't have expected warmth.

She shouldn't have expected anything.

But a part of her--the part that still remembered him in quieter moments--had hoped he would sound… different.

She forced herself to put the phone down.

She walked to the bathroom, splashed cold water on her face, and looked at herself in the mirror.

Her eyes looked the same.

Her mouth looked the same.

But there was something in her expression that she hadn't seen in a long time.

Tension.

Anticipation.

Fear.

She dried her hands slowly.

*You can do this,* she told herself.

*It's a weekend. You just have to get through a weekend.*

She returned to the room and began unpacking with controlled movements.

Dress on the hanger.

Skincare on the sink.

Shoes aligned.

She moved as if order could calm her.

Outside, the afternoon light softened.

By the time six o'clock approached, Nadia had changed into a simple blouse and skirt. She curled her hair lightly. She applied lipstick just enough to look alive.

She took one last breath before leaving the room.

The corridor was quiet again.

The elevator ride down felt too short.

When the doors opened to the lobby, Nadia stepped out into noise--guests gathering, laughter, staff directing people toward a function room.

She walked toward the crowd.

Then she saw him again.

Rai stood near a pillar, hands in his pockets, looking slightly out of place in the cheerful chaos.

He wasn't dressed formally yet--just a dark button-up and slacks--but he looked like he belonged in any room he entered.

Except his eyes.

His eyes were searching.

When they landed on Nadia, he went still.

Nadia's heart gave a hard thud.

They were only a few steps apart.

Close enough now for details.

The faint shadow of stubble along his jaw.

The way his hair fell just slightly over his forehead.

The way his gaze held her, steady and unreadable.

Nadia stopped.

Rai didn't move toward her right away.

He just looked.

As if he was measuring the distance between them and deciding what kind of man he was allowed to be now.

Nadia forced a small smile.

"Hi," she said again, because she didn't know what else could fit in that moment.

Rai's throat moved.

"Hi," he replied.

His voice was the same.

Low.

Controlled.

And somehow, hearing it in person made the ache in Nadia's chest bloom into something she almost couldn't contain.

They stood there, two people pretending to be adults about something that had once been their whole world.

Around them, wedding guests laughed, hugged, called out greetings.

Someone shouted, "Brennan!"

Nadia saw Rai's eyes flick briefly past her, as if he needed an excuse to breathe.

She understood.

She looked away too.

Then Rai spoke, quietly, as if he didn't want anyone else to hear.

"You look…"

He stopped.

His jaw tightened.

He didn't finish the sentence.

Nadia's fingers curled around her clutch.

"Okay," she offered, almost a whisper.

Rai's eyes returned to her.

Something flickered there.

Not warmth.

Not anger.

Just a familiar sadness.

"Yeah," he said. "Okay."

And in that single shared word, Nadia felt the truth settle in.

Being normal was going to be harder than she had imagined.

Because the space between them wasn't empty.

It was filled with everything they never resolved.

And tonight was only the beginning.

***

The function room doors opened, spilling warm light and chatter.

Nadia followed the flow of guests inside, her heels quiet on the carpet.

Rai walked beside her--not too close, not too far.

Close enough that Nadia could feel the heat of his presence.

Far enough that it still hurt.

Inside, the room was dressed in soft whites and pale florals, the kind of pre-wedding gathering that felt like a gentle rehearsal for love.

Nadia found her place among familiar faces.

Hugs.

Laughter.

People exclaiming at how long it had been.

And yet, even as she smiled and answered questions, part of her attention stayed fixed on Rai.

Where he stood.

Who he spoke to.

How he kept his expression calm.

How he never once looked truly relaxed.

As if his body was bracing for impact.

As if seeing her had reopened something he had worked hard to seal.

Nadia lifted her glass of water and took a slow sip.

Across the room, Rai's gaze met hers again.

This time, he didn't look away first.

And Nadia realized, with a quiet dread that curled in her stomach like smoke:

He hadn't moved on.

Not really.

And if she was honest with herself--neither had she.
