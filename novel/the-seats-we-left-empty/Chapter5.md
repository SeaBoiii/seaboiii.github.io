Title: The Almost Conversation
novel: the-seats-we-left-empty
order: 5
---

The ceremony began the way storms did--quietly, with everyone pretending they couldn't feel the air changing.

Rai stood at the ballroom entrance with a laminated seating chart in his hand, the paper already softening at the edges from sweat. The resort had turned the air-conditioning up so cold it felt like a challenge to the outside heat, but the crowd kept arriving in waves: aunties fanning themselves with invitations, uncles loosening collars, cousins balancing gift bags and toddlers.

People came dressed in their best versions of themselves. They laughed too loudly, hugged too tightly, spoke in the bright cadence of celebration.

Rai smiled when he needed to. He nodded. He guided.

But his mind kept snagging on the chairs.

Row after row of them--white, clean, aligned with the kind of precision that made you believe the world could be arranged neatly if you tried hard enough. Each chair held a folded program and a small tag with a name.

Some tags had been removed, moved, adjusted when last-minute changes happened.

Some chairs would stay empty.

That was normal at weddings, he told himself. People fell sick. Flights got delayed. Work emergencies happened.

Yet the sight of empty chairs made something tighten in his chest, as if every unoccupied seat was an echo of something unfinished.

Beside him, Nadia stood with her own copy of the seating plan, her posture composed, her expression calm enough that nobody would guess what it cost her to stand here--at the threshold of someone else's vows, forced into teamwork with the man she once almost promised her own forever to.

She wore the muted blue dress from the bridal palette, a shade that softened her but couldn't hide the tension in the way she held her shoulders. Her hair had been pinned back with a few strands deliberately loosened near her cheeks. Wedding makeup made her look luminous.

Rai tried not to look.

He failed.

He kept catching small details anyway--the slight tremor in her fingers when she lifted her chart, the way her eyes flicked across the room before settling somewhere neutral, the tiny breath she released after guiding another family.

They didn't talk much.

They didn't need to.

Their movements had a rhythm to them already, the kind you only developed when you had spent years learning each other's pace.

A group of older guests approached, uncertain and slightly flustered.

"Excuse me," an aunty said. "We are from bride side. Where we sit ah?"

Nadia smiled warmly. "Aunty, what's your name?"

The aunty said it, and Nadia found it quickly on the chart. "Okay, you are at Row C, seats three to five. Come, I show you."

Nadia led them down the aisle with gentle efficiency, guiding them like she had done this her whole life.

Rai watched her for a second longer than he should have.

Because it was still the same.

Her kindness wasn't a performance. It was a default.

She made people feel looked after.

Even when she herself wasn't.

He swallowed and turned to the next arriving guests.

Another family came--groom's side. A younger couple with a baby asleep against the father's chest.

Rai checked the chart, directed them to Row D, seat six onwards.

The father smiled gratefully. "Thanks bro. Wah, very organized."

Rai nodded. "No problem."

*Organized.*

People always said that about him.

They didn't see the mess underneath.

They didn't see how he used order to keep from breaking.

The doors to the ballroom remained open. Soft music drifted out--a string quartet warming up, notes like careful footsteps.

Rai glanced at his watch unconsciously.

The watch.

Nadia's watch.

He felt her notice it yesterday. The way her gaze had dropped, the way her voice had tightened when she said, *You still wear it.*

He hadn't known what to say.

Because the truth was simple and embarrassing.

He wore it because it still fit.

Because it reminded him, in the most practical way, that she had once chosen him.

Because keeping it on his wrist felt like keeping one thing from that life intact.

He didn't wear it to make her feel guilty.

He wore it because taking it off felt like erasing a part of his own history.

And he had done enough erasing already.

A familiar voice cut through the lobby noise.

"Eh, Rai!"

Kelvin approached with a grin, hair styled too neatly for this early hour, suit jacket unbuttoned like he wanted to look effortless.

Rai's stomach tightened.

Kelvin's eyes flicked to Nadia down the aisle and back. He waggled his eyebrows.

Rai kept his face neutral. "What?"

Kelvin held up his hands in mock innocence. "Nothing, nothing. I just want to say--good job ah. You and Nadia like professional ushers. Like wedding planners."

Rai's jaw tightened. "Kelvin."

Kelvin laughed quietly. "Okay lah okay lah. I'm just saying. Also--bro, after ceremony don't disappear. We need you take photo again."

Rai felt something in his chest sink. "Again?"

"Of course again," Kelvin said, delighted. "Wedding photos never end."

Rai exhaled slowly.

Kelvin leaned closer, lowering his voice with exaggerated secrecy. "Eh, I deleted the story already okay. Sherlyn scold me like I killed her cat."

Rai's eyes narrowed. "Don't post anymore."

Kelvin's grin softened slightly, the teasing slipping into something more genuine. "Okay lah. I won't. I know it's… sensitive."

Sensitive.

That was a kind word for it.

Kelvin nudged Rai's shoulder lightly. "You okay or not, bro?"

Rai stared at him.

He could have answered with his usual.

*Okay.*

But the word felt heavy today.

He didn't trust himself with it.

So he said the truth, smaller.

"I'm managing."

Kelvin studied him for a beat, then nodded once. "Steady. Later if need distraction, you come find me. I can talk rubbish until you forget your own name."

Rai almost smiled.

Almost.

Kelvin walked off to join another group.

Rai turned back just as Nadia returned from seating the bride's aunties.

Their eyes met briefly.

Nadia's expression was composed, but her gaze held a question.

Rai looked away first.

Not because he didn't want to look.

Because looking felt like losing control.

***

When the doors finally closed and the music shifted, the ballroom changed.

The chatter softened into a hush. People rose. Phones lifted. A collective breath held.

Rai and Nadia moved to the side, near the entrance, out of the camera's main line.

They weren't part of the procession.

Yet they were trapped in the same view of it.

The bride's father stepped forward first, his face set in a proud tenderness. The bride appeared a moment later, and the room exhaled.

Lena looked radiant.

The kind of radiant that made love look easy.

Her gown caught light like water. Her bouquet trembled slightly in her hands, and her smile was so bright it made everyone else look dull by comparison.

Brennan stood at the front, waiting.

Rai watched him.

Brennan's hands were clasped in front of him, but Rai could see the way his fingers flexed, the small tremor that betrayed nerves.

Then Brennan saw the bride.

And his face--his entire face--changed.

The grin that broke through him wasn't practiced. It was involuntary.

It was love with nothing held back.

Rai's chest tightened.

It wasn't envy exactly.

It was grief.

Because he remembered what it felt like to look at someone like that.

He remembered looking at Nadia as if she was the only good thing in his life.

And he remembered how, somewhere along the way, he had stopped showing it.

Beside him, Nadia stood very still.

Rai could feel her presence like a low hum. He didn't look at her immediately. He didn't want to see her reaction.

But the vows began.

The officiant's voice was warm and calm, guiding the couple through promises everyone in the room pretended were simple.

Brennan spoke first.

He made jokes, as expected, then his voice softened.

"When I think about forever," Brennan said, "I don't think about big things. I think about small things. Like coming home and knowing you're there. Like having someone who sees me even when I'm… messy."

A ripple of laughter.

Then silence.

Brennan continued, "I promise to show up. I promise to not run. I promise to always make space for you in my life, even when life gets hard."

Make space.

Rai's throat tightened.

His gaze flicked to the front row.

There was an empty seat near the aisle.

A program rested on it like someone had placed it there with care.

A small framed photo sat at the edge of the chair.

Rai realized, slowly, that it wasn't a random empty seat.

It was reserved.

For someone who couldn't be there.

A parent.

A late relative.

A presence honored by absence.

The realization hit him with surprising force.

Because he understood that kind of seat.

The one that remained empty not because nobody wanted it filled--

But because it belonged to someone, still.

Nadia's breath caught beside him.

Rai turned his head slightly, just enough to see her without making it obvious.

Her eyes were fixed on the empty chair too.

Her throat moved.

The expression on her face was not heartbreak.

It was recognition.

She understood it too.

She understood that sometimes absence was a kind of devotion.

Rai's chest tightened.

The bride began her vows.

Her voice shook slightly at first, then steadied.

"I promise to choose you," Lena said, eyes shining. "Even when you're difficult. Even when you're quiet. Even when you don't know how to say what you feel."

Rai felt a sharp ache behind his ribs.

Even when you don't know how to say what you feel.

The words were innocent in Lena's mouth.

But in Rai's mind, they became Nadia's.

Because that had been their problem.

He hadn't known how to say it.

How to explain that his silence wasn't indifference.

It was fear.

Fear that if he let her see how tired he was, she would see him as less.

Fear that if he leaned on her, he would become a burden.

Fear that love was something you earned by being steady.

He had tried to be steady.

He had forgotten that love also required softness.

The vows ended.

The kiss happened.

The room erupted into applause.

Phones snapped photos.

Laughter rose.

Music swelled.

Rai clapped with everyone else, his hands moving automatically.

But his chest felt hollow.

Beside him, Nadia clapped too.

Her smile was gentle.

And there, in the curve of her mouth, Rai saw something that made his heart twist.

Sadness.

Not bitterness.

Not regret.

Just quiet sadness.

As if the sight of vows had reminded her that once, she had wanted that with him.

And she had lost it.

Rai looked away.

He couldn't survive too many seconds of seeing that.

***

After the ceremony, the world accelerated.

People surged forward for congratulations. Flashbulbs popped. Children ran between adults like loose confetti.

Brennan grabbed Rai in a crushing hug.

"Bro! Thanks for helping," Brennan said, breathless with joy. "You and Nadia saved my life."

Rai smiled. "Congrats."

Brennan pulled back, eyes shining. "Later dinner, okay? Don't go missing. We need all the gang. Tonight we drink."

Rai's stomach tightened. "You drink. I drive."

Brennan laughed. "Okay lah, responsible." Then he leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Eh, you and Nadia okay right?"

Rai's throat tightened.

Brennan's face held concern beneath the excitement.

Rai kept his expression neutral. "We're okay."

There it was.

The lie that sounded like truth.

Brennan studied him for a moment, then nodded slowly. "Okay. Just… don't make it harder than it needs to be, bro. Life too short."

Rai's jaw tightened.

Brennan meant well.

But Rai wanted to ask him--

Do you know what it feels like to love someone and still fail them?

Do you know what it feels like to carry that quiet failure for years?

He didn't ask.

He just nodded.

"Enjoy your day," Rai said.

Brennan grinned and rushed off again, swallowed by hugs.

Rai turned and saw Nadia speaking with Lena's mother, her smile gentle, her hands gesturing politely.

She looked so normal.

As if she hadn't just watched vows with a face that had cracked slightly.

Rai's chest tightened.

He moved away before he could be pulled into her orbit again.

The reception was scheduled later in the evening. Between ceremony and dinner, guests dispersed to rest, change, and recover.

Rai returned to his room with his tie loosened, his shoes heavy in his hands.

He stood in the doorway for a moment, listening to the silence.

No laughter here.

No music.

Just the hum of air-conditioning.

He set his shoes down neatly, as if order could help him breathe.

Then he sat on the edge of the bed and stared at his hands.

His watch caught the light.

A small glint.

A reminder.

He took a slow breath.

In his mind, Nadia's voice from years ago surfaced like a ghost.

*Are you ever going to let me in?*

He had answered with logic.

With practicality.

With the wrong language.

Now, standing in this hotel room while the world celebrated love downstairs, Rai felt the familiar panic of a man who had never learned how to hold his heart without clenching.

He reached for his phone.

He opened Nadia's chat.

He stared at the last messages again, the old silence.

He typed.

Then deleted.

Typed again.

Deleted again.

He couldn't find a sentence that didn't feel like stepping off a cliff.

So he put the phone down.

And lay back.

Eyes open.

Waiting for evening.

Waiting for the part of the wedding that would be the hardest.

Dinner.

Speeches.

Music.

Love displayed like a performance.

And Nadia sitting beside him at Table 8, close enough to breathe the same air.

***

By seven, the ballroom had transformed again.

Lights dimmed into warm gold. Tables glowed with candles. The air smelled of wine and perfume and food rich enough to make people forget their worries.

Rai entered quietly, scanning for Table 8.

He found it near the center again.

His name card.

Her name card.

Side by side.

The same joke.

The same dare.

Nadia was already seated.

She had changed into a darker dress--deep navy, elegant, her hair loosened into soft waves. The makeup was the same but slightly more dramatic under the ballroom lights.

She looked beautiful.

Rai told himself not to think that.

His body ignored him.

He took his seat beside her.

Their shoulders were close.

Not touching.

Close enough that Rai could feel the heat of her arm.

Nadia glanced at him.

Her expression was polite.

Her eyes held something careful.

"Hi," she said.

Rai nodded. "Hi."

There was that small, awkward pause where both of them waited for a version of normal that didn't exist.

Kelvin arrived in a burst of energy, slapping Rai's back.

"Wah, you two early," Kelvin said, grinning. "Steady. Reserved seats."

Rai's jaw tightened.

Nadia's mouth curved politely. "We're just punctual."

Kelvin waggled his eyebrows. "Punctual together."

Sherlyn appeared right behind Kelvin and slapped the back of his head. "Shut up. Eat."

Kelvin yelped. "Eh, why everyone hit me today?"

Jun arrived too, quiet as always, taking his seat across from Rai.

The table filled.

Conversation began.

Safe topics.

Work.

Food.

Travel.

Rai participated enough to look normal.

But his attention kept slipping to Nadia.

The way she held her fork.

The way she drank water between bites.

The way she laughed softly at Sherlyn's teasing.

The way her eyes sometimes drifted toward the stage, as if she was bracing for speeches.

Speeches began.

Brennan's brothers made jokes.

Lena's friends cried.

A childhood video played, making the room roar with laughter.

Rai smiled.

Clapped.

Did the motions.

But in the middle of it, one of the speakers said something that made his chest tighten.

"To Lena and Brennan," the speaker said, raising a glass, "thank you for showing us what it means to choose each other, again and again."

Choose each other.

Again and again.

Rai's throat tightened.

Beside him, Nadia's fingers curled around her napkin.

The room applauded.

Music swelled.

A song began--slow, romantic, generic enough to belong to any couple.

Yet the melody carried something that tugged at Rai's memory.

Not an exact song.

But the feeling of one.

The kind of ballad that used to play in his car while Nadia stared out the window and pretended she wasn't happy.

Rai's jaw tightened.

He reached for his water.

His fingers brushed Nadia's as they both reached for the same glass pitcher.

The touch was brief.

Accidental.

But Rai's body reacted like it was an alarm.

He pulled his hand back too quickly.

Nadia froze.

Her eyes flicked to him.

Rai forced himself to breathe.

"Sorry," he muttered.

Nadia nodded once. "It's okay."

Okay.

Again.

The word sat between them like a thin wall.

Dinner continued.

Dessert arrived.

Kelvin grew louder with alcohol.

Sherlyn grew more amused.

Jun remained quiet, occasionally offering a dry comment that made Sherlyn laugh.

Nadia drank only water.

Rai noticed.

He didn't say anything.

He knew better than to comment on her choices.

He had spent too long controlling his own life to want to control hers.

The reception moved toward its late stage.

Some guests went out to the balcony for fresh air.

Others clustered near the photo booth.

The dance floor opened.

Music shifted into something upbeat.

Kelvin dragged Sherlyn out, despite her protests.

Jun stayed seated, smiling faintly.

Rai remained.

Nadia remained.

The space at the table grew quieter as more people left.

Rai stared at the candle centerpiece, watching the flame flicker.

Nadia's voice broke the silence.

"Are you… leaving tonight?"

Rai blinked.

The question was small, but it held weight.

"No," he said. "Brennan booked rooms for everyone. I'm staying."

Nadia nodded slowly. "Me too."

Rai's chest tightened.

He didn't reply.

Because what could he say?

*I know.*

*I'm aware you're in this building.*

*I can feel you even when I'm not looking.*

Instead he asked, quietly, "You okay?"

Nadia's mouth curved faintly, almost humorless. "We keep asking that."

Rai's throat tightened. "Yeah."

Nadia stared at the candle flame for a moment.

Then she said softly, "The vows were… nice."

Rai's jaw tightened.

Nice.

A small word for something that had felt like a knife.

He nodded once. "Yeah."

Another silence.

Nadia's fingers traced the rim of her water glass.

Rai watched them.

Then Nadia spoke again, voice low.

"I didn't realize… weddings still affect me."

Rai's chest tightened.

He looked at her.

Her gaze remained on the table, but her expression had softened. Not into vulnerability exactly.

Into honesty.

Rai swallowed.

He could say something safe.

He could say, *It's normal.*

But safe sentences were the ones that had killed them.

So he said nothing.

Nadia's eyes flicked up to him.

She held his gaze for a beat.

Then she looked away.

"Never mind," she murmured.

The sentence landed like a door closing.

Rai's chest tightened.

He had done that to her too many times.

He had watched her open herself slightly, then retreat when he gave her nothing.

Now he was doing it again.

Because he didn't know how to change quickly.

Not in a ballroom.

Not with candles and witnesses.

Not with the past staring.

A staff member walked by and asked if they wanted more drinks.

Both of them said no.

The staff member moved on.

Rai exhaled slowly.

He couldn't keep sitting here like this.

It was a slow torture.

"I'm going to get some air," he said.

Nadia nodded. "Okay."

Rai stood.

His chair scraped softly.

He walked toward the balcony.

The night air outside was humid, the sea smell stronger. Lights from the resort reflected on the water like scattered coins.

He leaned his forearms against the railing.

Below, palm fronds moved in the breeze.

Guests laughed somewhere behind him.

Rai closed his eyes.

He tried to breathe.

He tried to reset.

But all he could see was Nadia's face during the vows.

The slight tightening of her mouth.

The way her eyes had brightened with emotion she refused to show.

Rai's chest ached.

A footstep behind him.

He opened his eyes.

Nadia stood a few feet away, holding her clutch against her body like a shield.

"I thought you might be here," she said softly.

Rai swallowed.

He didn't ask why.

They both knew.

Nadia moved closer to the railing, but she left space between them.

The distance was deliberate.

A respect.

Or a fear.

They stood in silence for a moment, listening to the sea.

The sounds were small--waves, distant traffic, a soft laugh drifting from another balcony.

Nadia spoke first.

"I'm going to turn in early," she said.

Rai nodded. "Yeah. Same."

A pause.

Nadia's fingers tightened around her clutch.

Then she said, quieter, "Can we… talk?"

Rai's chest tightened.

His mind surged.

Talk.

About what?

About the ending?

About the reasons?

About the fact that he still wore her watch?

About the fact that her presence still made him feel like his life had split into two timelines--before her and after her?

He looked at her.

Nadia's eyes were on the sea, not on him.

As if she couldn't bear to watch his reaction.

Rai's throat moved.

"Now?" he asked quietly.

Nadia nodded once. "If you're okay with it."

Okay.

The word again.

Rai's jaw tightened.

He wanted to say no.

He wanted to protect himself.

But he also wanted--desperately--to know what she would say.

He nodded once.

"Okay," he said.

Nadia exhaled, relief and fear mixing.

"Not here," she said softly. "Too many people."

Rai nodded.

They walked back inside.

Not together, not separate.

A careful parallel.

They moved through corridors until they reached the quieter hallway of guest rooms.

The resort lighting here was softer, more private. The carpet muffled footsteps. The air smelled faintly of detergent and floral cleaning solution.

Nadia stopped near a vending machine alcove, where the hum of the machine filled the silence like a heartbeat.

Rai stopped too.

They stood facing each other, a few feet apart.

For a moment, neither spoke.

The quiet pressed.

Nadia swallowed.

"I…" she began.

Then she stopped.

Her eyes flicked away, as if words were too sharp to hold.

Rai waited.

He kept his posture steady, but inside his chest, everything was shaking.

Nadia tried again.

"I wanted to say--"

She exhaled.

Her fingers tightened around her clutch.

Rai's throat tightened.

He realized, suddenly, that Nadia was nervous.

Nadia--the woman who could lead aunties to seats with a smile, who could wear a dress under ballroom lights and look unbothered--was nervous now.

Because this was real.

This was the room where they could hurt each other again.

Nadia's voice came out quieter.

"I'm sorry," she said.

The words landed softly.

But they hit Rai like a punch.

He didn't move.

He didn't react.

Because if he reacted, he might break.

Nadia continued, voice trembling slightly. "Not for leaving. I still… I still think I had to. But I'm sorry for how I did it. For the way I made you… carry it alone."

Rai's chest tightened until he could barely breathe.

Carry it alone.

She knew.

She knew he had carried it.

His jaw clenched.

He should say something.

He should accept the apology, like an adult.

He should reassure her.

But the truth rose like a tide.

He had carried it.

Every day.

He had carried it while pretending he was fine.

He had carried it while his mother asked gentle questions he couldn't answer.

He had carried it while friends moved on, married, built families.

He had carried it while the seat beside his heart stayed empty.

Rai's throat moved.

He forced his voice steady.

"You didn't make me carry it," he said. "I chose to."

Nadia flinched slightly.

Rai hated himself for the sharpness.

But it was true.

He had chosen silence.

He had chosen pride.

He had chosen to be strong instead of honest.

Nadia's eyes glistened faintly.

"That's the problem," she whispered. "You always choose to carry everything alone."

Rai's chest tightened.

There it was.

The old argument.

Not loud.

Not dramatic.

Still dangerous.

Rai swallowed.

He looked away briefly, staring at the vending machine lights. Chips. Candy bars. Bottled tea.

Ordinary things.

He wished their pain could be as ordinary.

Nadia took a slow breath.

"I'm not here to fight," she said softly. "I just… I didn't want to pretend we're strangers. Not after… everything."

Rai's jaw tightened.

Everything.

That word held too much.

He looked back at her.

Nadia's eyes held his now.

"Did you hate me?" she asked.

The question was quiet.

But it was the kind that could split a person open.

Rai's breath caught.

Hate.

No.

He had never hated her.

He had hated himself.

He had hated the way he couldn't be what she needed.

He had hated the way she could walk away even while loving him.

He had hated the emptiness.

Rai's throat tightened.

"No," he said, voice low. "I didn't hate you."

Nadia's shoulders sagged slightly, relief washing through her.

Rai continued, softer, almost unwilling. "I hated… that you were right."

Nadia froze.

Her eyes widened slightly.

Rai felt his chest ache.

He hadn't meant to say that.

But it was out now.

Nadia's lips parted.

She looked like she wanted to step closer.

But she didn't.

"Rai…" she whispered.

Rai swallowed.

He felt something dangerous rising--hope, anger, grief.

He didn't know how to hold it.

He didn't trust himself.

Nadia's voice trembled slightly. "I didn't want to be right. I wanted you to let me in."

Rai's jaw tightened.

He looked away.

Because that sentence--

It was the sentence that had ended them.

He could hear her saying it years ago, eyes tired, hands shaking slightly.

*I wanted you to let me in.*

And him--too proud, too scared--answering with logic.

Now, in this vending machine alcove, he felt the same old panic.

He couldn't rewrite years of habit in one night.

Nadia stepped closer by a fraction.

Not touching.

But close enough that Rai could see the sheen in her eyes.

"I'm not asking for anything," she said softly, voice thick. "I just… I needed to know if I mattered to you. Still."

Rai's chest tightened.

The answer was obvious.

Too obvious.

It terrified him.

Because if he admitted it, he would be giving her power again.

The power to leave.

The power to hurt.

But he also knew--

If he didn't admit it, he would lose her completely.

Again.

Rai's throat moved.

He tried to speak.

No sound came.

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

A sudden vibration.

A lifeline.

Or a curse.

Rai didn't check it immediately.

Nadia's gaze flicked to his pocket.

The buzz came again.

Insistent.

Rai exhaled and pulled the phone out.

A call.

**Mum**

Rai's stomach dropped.

He hesitated.

Nadia watched him, eyes wide.

Rai swallowed. "I have to take this."

Nadia nodded quickly, stepping back. "Yeah. Of course."

Rai answered.

"Hello?"

His mother's voice came through urgent, tight. "Rai, where are you? You at the wedding?"

Rai's chest tightened. "Yeah. What happened?"

A pause. Then his mother said, "Your auntie fell. At home. Not serious, but she dizzy, we going clinic now. I just want to tell you--don't worry, but… can you come tomorrow morning? Help with some things. I alone cannot carry."

Rai's jaw tightened.

Of course.

Of course life would choose this moment.

He closed his eyes.

"Okay," he said automatically.

His mother exhaled, relieved. "Okay. You don't need to rush now. Tonight enjoy. Tomorrow come."

Enjoy.

Rai almost laughed.

"Okay," he repeated.

After the call ended, the hallway felt colder.

Rai lowered his phone slowly.

He realized, with a sharp sinking feeling, that the moment had passed.

Nadia's posture had shifted.

Her shoulders were up again.

Her face composed.

The vulnerable Nadia who had asked *Did you hate me?* was already retreating.

Rai's chest tightened.

He wanted to pull her back.

He wanted to say the words he had almost said.

But Nadia spoke first, voice steady now.

"Family?" she asked.

Rai nodded. "My aunt fell. She's okay."

Nadia's expression softened briefly, genuine concern. "Okay. Good."

Okay.

Again.

Rai swallowed.

He could feel the conversation slipping.

He could feel himself failing again.

He tried.

"Nadia," he said.

Her eyes lifted.

Rai's throat tightened.

He wanted to answer her question.

*Did you matter to me?*

Yes.

Still.

Always.

But the words jammed in his throat like something too big to swallow.

He managed, instead, a smaller truth.

"I… didn't stop caring," he said.

Nadia's breath caught.

For a second, her face softened again.

Then she smiled--small, careful.

"Okay," she whispered.

It wasn't reassurance.

It wasn't acceptance.

It was a way to end the sentence without letting it become dangerous.

Rai's chest tightened.

Nadia stepped back another inch.

"We should sleep," she said softly. "Tomorrow is still… long."

Rai nodded.

He wanted to stop her.

But he didn't.

Nadia turned slightly toward her room.

Then paused.

She looked back at him.

Her eyes held something that made Rai's chest ache.

A question.

A hope.

A fear.

As if she was waiting for him to say something that would make staying worth it.

Rai opened his mouth.

Nothing came.

Nadia's gaze dropped.

She nodded once, almost to herself.

"Goodnight, Rai."

Rai's throat tightened. "Goodnight."

She walked away.

Her heels were quiet on the carpet.

The sound faded.

Rai stood there alone beside the humming vending machine, the lights reflecting off glass and plastic.

He stared at the spot where Nadia had stood.

He felt the failure settle in his chest like weight.

He had been given a chance--small, fragile.

And life had interrupted.

But even without the call, he wasn't sure he would have been brave enough.

Rai looked down at his wrist.

The watch glinted under the hallway light.

Time.

Always time.

He wondered, suddenly, how many more chances he would waste before Nadia stopped offering them.

Back in his room, he lay on the bed with the lights off.

The resort was quiet now, the celebration exhausted.

Somewhere down the corridor, a door closed softly.

Rai stared at the ceiling.

He thought about the empty seat in the front row.

Reserved.

Honored.

Unfilled.

Then he thought about Nadia.

The seat beside him at Table 8.

The way the camera made them look normal.

The way her voice trembled when she apologized.

The way she asked if she mattered.

Rai closed his eyes.

His chest hurt.

Because he knew the truth.

He hadn't just kept a seat empty for her.

He had kept his whole life slightly unfinished--

as if waiting for the day she might sit down again and say,

*Okay. Let's try.*

And tonight, when she had almost offered that--

he had almost reached.

Almost.

Rai's phone lit up on the bedside table.

A new message.

From Nadia.

He stared at the screen, heart thudding.

The message was short.

**Nadia:** Tomorrow… can we talk properly?

Rai's throat tightened.

Properly.

The word felt like a promise and a threat.

He stared at the message until the screen dimmed.

Outside, the sea kept moving.

Inside, Rai's heart did too--slow, stubborn, refusing to settle.

He didn't reply.

Not yet.

Because he didn't know if he could do *properly.*

Because he didn't know if he could open the door without losing himself.

But in the dark, with the watch on his wrist and Nadia's question glowing in his mind, Rai realized something that tightened his chest with equal parts fear and longing:

Tomorrow would not allow him to hide.

Not if Nadia was finally asking him to show up.
