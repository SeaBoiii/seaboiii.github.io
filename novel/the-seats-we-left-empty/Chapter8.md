The second time they met, it was easier in the way a bruise becomes familiar.

Not less painful.

Just expected.

Rai texted Nadia on Thursday evening, after his therapy session.

**Rai:** I'm free tomorrow night. Dinner? Your choice.

Nadia stared at the message for a long time.

Your choice.

It sounded small.

But it wasn't.

Rai was offering her control.

Rai--who used to control distance by withholding--was offering her the ability to decide the shape of a moment.

Nadia breathed out slowly.

**Nadia:** Tiong Bahru. Simple place. 7.30.

**Rai:** Okay.

The word again.

But this time it landed like consistency.

***

Tiong Bahru at night was warmer than she remembered--humid air thick with the smell of char kway teow, kopi, and wet pavement. The old estate carried a quiet charm that felt like nostalgia without trying too hard. Yellow streetlights softened the edges of the world. Couples walked slower here.

Nadia arrived early.

Of course she did.

She chose a small restaurant tucked along a quiet row--casual enough to not feel like a date, intimate enough to force honesty. The kind of place where you had to lean in to hear each other over soft chatter.

She sat at a table near the wall, her back not to the entrance.

Not because she feared danger.

Because she feared surprise.

At 7:21, Rai walked in.

He wore a simple button-up with sleeves rolled, dark jeans, hair slightly damp as if he'd showered right before leaving. His posture was straight but not stiff. There was a small change in him Nadia couldn't name.

Maybe it was the fact that he didn't pause at the entrance like he used to.

He saw her and walked over immediately.

No hovering.

No hesitation.

Just movement.

Nadia's throat tightened.

He stopped at her table.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi," she replied.

He pulled out the chair across from her and sat.

Their eyes held for a beat.

Something unspoken passed between them.

Not romance.

Not yet.

A shared awareness.

They were doing this.

For real.

A waiter came, handed menus, asked for drinks.

Rai ordered water.

Nadia ordered tea.

The waiter left.

Silence settled.

Not awkward.

Just full.

Rai spoke first.

"My aunt is okay," he said, as if giving her the update he owed. "She's on medication now. Doctor said she needs to slow down."

Nadia nodded. "That's good."

Rai's mouth tightened slightly. "My mum doesn't know how to slow down."

Nadia's lips curved faintly. "Neither do you."

Rai's eyes lifted.

For a second, something like amusement touched his gaze.

Then it faded into something softer.

"Yeah," he admitted.

The waiter returned for orders.

They chose dishes that were safe--shared plates, nothing too heavy. The act of selecting food felt strangely intimate, like two people learning how to exist in the same space again.

When the waiter left, Nadia clasped her hands together on the table.

"Did therapy help?" she asked carefully.

Rai exhaled slowly. "It helps in a… annoying way."

Nadia blinked. "Annoying?"

Rai's mouth curved faintly. "Because it makes me answer questions I don't want to answer."

Nadia almost smiled.

That sounded like him.

Honest enough to admit discomfort.

Not hiding behind politeness.

Rai continued, voice low. "My therapist asked me why I treat emotions like… problems to solve. And why I think being needed is the same as being loved."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She looked at him.

His gaze stayed on the table for a moment, as if he needed distance from the vulnerability.

Then he looked back up.

"I realized," he said, quieter, "I learned love like that."

Nadia's throat tightened.

From family.

From culture.

From years of being told that a good man carried without complaint.

She didn't interrupt.

Rai's voice steadied. "When my dad left, my mum worked two jobs. I became… the other adult."

Nadia's breath caught.

She knew pieces of this.

Not all.

Rai had never told her properly.

He had mentioned his dad in passing, always casual, always dismissive.

*He's not around.*

As if the absence wasn't a wound.

Rai continued, "I used to think if I didn't create problems, if I didn't ask for anything, my mum would have one less thing to worry about."

Nadia's chest tightened.

Rai's fingers curled slightly on the table. "So I became… useful. Quiet. Easy."

Easy.

Nadia swallowed.

She remembered their early days.

Rai who never demanded.

Rai who always paid.

Rai who always offered help.

Rai who apologized too quickly.

Rai who never cried.

Rai's voice dropped. "When I love someone, my instinct is to protect them by not needing them."

Nadia's throat tightened.

"And that's why you shut me out," she whispered.

Rai nodded once.

The waiter arrived with food, placing plates down with practiced care.

The interruption felt almost cruel.

A sizzling dish between them.

Steam rising.

Life insisting on normalcy.

Rai waited until the waiter left.

Then he looked at Nadia again.

"I want to tell you the truth you've been avoiding," he said quietly.

Nadia's stomach tightened.

The truth.

There were many.

But she knew which one he meant.

Because it had been the ghost in every conversation.

The night she left.

Why.

What broke them.

Rai's gaze held hers.

"We never fought properly," he said. "We never said the thing out loud."

Nadia's throat tightened.

Rai continued, voice low but steady. "You thought I didn't want you. You thought I didn't choose you."

Nadia's chest tightened until it hurt.

She did think that.

She remembered the way she had watched him work late, shoulder tight, eyes tired, and still refuse to lean on her.

She remembered the way he would say *I'm fine*, then disappear into himself.

She remembered feeling like a guest in her own relationship.

Rai's voice softened. "And I thought you would leave eventually anyway. Because you deserved better."

Nadia's mouth tightened.

"I never wanted better," she whispered. "I wanted you."

Rai's eyes flickered.

The words landed like something sharp.

Nadia's hands tightened around her chopsticks.

She forced herself to keep breathing.

Rai continued, "The night you left… you asked me if I was ever going to let you in."

Nadia's throat tightened.

The memory rose--her own voice, tired, trembling with frustration she had tried to hide.

Rai's jaw tightened slightly. "And I said… I said I was trying. I said you were overthinking."

Nadia flinched.

Because it had hurt.

It had made her feel stupid for needing what she needed.

Rai's voice grew quieter. "But that wasn't the worst part."

Nadia's stomach sank.

Rai stared at his food for a moment.

Then he lifted his gaze.

"The worst part," he said, "was when you asked me if I wanted a future with you."

Nadia's breath caught.

She remembered.

She remembered standing in his kitchen, the smell of detergent and cold rice, her bag already half-packed because she had started preparing to leave even before she admitted it.

*Do you even want a future with me?*

She remembered his face.

The way he went still.

The way his eyes flicked away.

His silence.

That silence had been the final cut.

Nadia's throat tightened.

Rai's voice was low. "I didn't answer because I didn't want you. I didn't answer because… I was terrified."

Nadia stared.

Rai continued, "My mum was drowning with bills. My aunt was sick. My project at work was collapsing. And you were asking me to promise forever."

Nadia's chest tightened.

Her mouth opened.

Rai held up a hand slightly, not stopping her, just asking for space.

"I know," he said quickly, "I know it sounds like excuses. But I need you to understand--when you asked me for that promise, I felt like I was being asked to carry something else I might fail."

Nadia's throat tightened.

So that was it.

Not a lack of love.

A fear of failure.

Rai's voice softened. "And instead of telling you that… instead of saying, 'I'm scared, I'm overwhelmed, I want you but I don't know how to be ready'--I went quiet."

Nadia's eyes burned.

She blinked fast.

Rai's jaw tightened. "I thought if I delayed, if I stayed vague, you would… adjust. Like everyone else. Like my mum."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She shook her head slowly.

"You thought I would lower my needs," she whispered.

Rai swallowed hard. "Yes."

The honesty was brutal.

Nadia's hands trembled.

She set her chopsticks down carefully, as if the act of placing them down could keep her from shaking apart.

"I didn't leave because you weren't ready," she said, voice thick. "I left because you didn't trust me with the truth."

Rai's eyes held hers.

Nadia continued, voice trembling slightly. "You didn't have to promise forever. I didn't need a ring. I needed you to look at me and say, 'I'm scared, but I still want you in my life.'"

Rai's throat moved.

His eyes glistened faintly.

"I know," he whispered.

Nadia exhaled shakily.

She stared at the food, appetite gone.

Rai's voice came quieter. "And I also… need you to know something else."

Nadia's stomach tightened.

Another truth.

Rai's jaw tightened as if he was forcing the words out.

"That night," he said, "after you left, I sat on the floor in the kitchen. For a long time."

Nadia's breath caught.

Rai's eyes stayed on the table. "I didn't cry. Not then. But I… couldn't move."

Nadia's throat tightened.

Rai's voice turned rougher. "And the next day, I called you. Once."

Nadia froze.

Rai looked up.

His eyes held hers.

"I called," he repeated, "and it went to voicemail. And I told myself that was your answer. So I didn't call again."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She stared at him, shocked.

"I didn't… I didn't see any missed call," she whispered.

Rai's jaw tightened. "Maybe I dialed wrong. Maybe… maybe the call didn't go through. I don't know. But I remember pressing call. I remember holding the phone like it weighed a hundred kilograms."

Nadia's eyes burned.

The tragedy of it--how small a thing could become fate.

A missed call.

A wrong digit.

A moment that could have been a bridge, lost.

Nadia swallowed hard.

"And after that?" she asked, voice fragile.

Rai's expression tightened.

"I waited," he said.

Two syllables.

Heavy.

Nadia's chest tightened.

Rai continued, voice low. "I waited for you to message. I waited for you to come back. And every day you didn't, I told myself you were happier."

Nadia's throat tightened.

She looked down.

She remembered those days too.

The way she had stared at her phone.

The way she had waited for him to fight.

The way she had told herself, *If he loves me, he'll come.*

And he hadn't.

So she had forced herself to stop waiting.

She had blocked him on Instagram not out of anger, but out of survival.

She had kept his number unblocked for months, still hoping.

Then, slowly, she had deleted it.

Because hope was a kind of slow poison.

Nadia's eyes filled.

She blinked fast.

Rai's voice softened, almost breaking. "I'm sorry I made you feel alone. I'm sorry I made love feel like work."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She pressed her fingertips to the edge of the table to steady herself.

The restaurant noise felt distant now.

Plates clinking.

Laughter.

A couple whispering.

All of it happening in a world where love wasn't a wound.

Nadia swallowed.

She looked at Rai.

His eyes were glossy.

He looked like a man holding himself together with sheer will.

The sight made Nadia ache.

Because she had wanted him to be this honest years ago.

Because she had loved him even when he couldn't be.

Because she still did.

Nadia's voice came out soft.

"I'm sorry too," she said.

Rai froze.

Nadia continued, voice trembling. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you my fear properly either. I left quietly because I was afraid if I stayed another day, I would… accept your silence as normal."

Rai's throat moved.

Nadia's eyes burned. "And I was angry. I was angry that I loved you so much, and you still couldn't let me in."

Rai nodded slowly.

He didn't argue.

He didn't defend.

He just listened.

Nadia exhaled.

Her voice softened further. "I don't hate you, Rai."

Rai's eyes lifted.

Nadia held his gaze.

"I was just tired," she whispered.

Rai's breath hitched.

The word tired contained everything.

Nadia looked away briefly, wiping a tear quickly before it could fall.

When she looked back, her expression had steadied.

She drew a slow breath.

"So this is the truth," she said quietly. "You didn't answer because you were scared. And I left because you wouldn't tell me you were scared."

Rai nodded once.

"Yes."

The simplicity of it hurt.

So much pain built from one unspoken sentence.

Nadia stared at her tea.

The steam had faded.

She realized she was cold.

Rai spoke softly. "I can't change what happened. But I can… change how I show up now."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She looked at him.

His gaze was steady.

Not perfect.

But present.

Nadia swallowed.

"What do we do now?" she asked.

Rai exhaled slowly.

"I don't know," he admitted. "But I know I don't want to go back to silence."

Nadia's throat tightened.

She nodded slowly.

Neither did she.

They ate a little, mostly out of obligation. Food tasted dull.

Yet something had shifted.

Not healed.

But named.

When the dinner ended, Rai insisted on walking Nadia to the bus stop.

The night air was warm. The estate was quiet. A few cyclists passed, bell chiming softly.

They walked side by side.

Not touching.

But closer than before.

At the bus stop, Nadia stopped.

Rai stopped too.

They faced each other under the yellow light.

Nadia's heart thudded.

The silence between them was different now.

Not avoidance.

Just… breath.

Rai swallowed.

"I'm glad you asked me to talk properly," he said.

Nadia's throat tightened.

"I'm glad you came," she replied.

Rai's eyes softened.

For a second, he looked like he wanted to reach out.

His hand lifted slightly.

Then he stopped himself.

Nadia noticed.

The restraint.

The respect.

It made her chest ache.

Rai exhaled slowly.

"I won't touch you unless you want me to," he said quietly.

The sentence wasn't seductive.

It was careful.

It was him acknowledging boundaries in the clearest way he could.

Nadia's breath caught.

She nodded once.

"Okay," she whispered.

The bus arrived.

Doors hissed open.

Nadia stepped onto it.

She turned back once.

Rai stood under the streetlight, hands in his pockets, watching her.

Not chasing.

Not disappearing.

Just… there.

Nadia held his gaze for a beat.

Then she turned and walked down the aisle.

As the bus pulled away, she watched him through the window until he became a smaller figure, then just another shadow on the street.

Her chest felt heavy.

But also lighter.

Because the truth--finally spoken--had given the pain a shape.

And shapes could be held.

They could be carried.

They could, maybe, be laid down.

Nadia leaned her head lightly against the bus window.

The city lights blurred.

Her phone buzzed.

A new message from Rai.

**Rai:** Thank you for telling me the truth.

Nadia stared at it.

Her fingers moved.

**Nadia:** Don't go quiet again.

A pause.

Then:

**Rai:** I won't.

Nadia's chest tightened.

Promises were still dangerous.

But this one--

This one didn't feel like a fantasy.

It felt like a man, finally learning, choosing a different kind of strength.

And Nadia, finally, letting herself consider the possibility that the seat beside her heart might not stay empty forever.

Not because fate insisted.

But because both of them--

for the first time--were willing to sit down and stay.
