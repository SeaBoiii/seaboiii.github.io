It didn't happen all at once.

There was no single day where Nadia woke up and decided, *Yes. I trust you again.*

Trust didn't arrive like fireworks.

It arrived like habit.

A series of ordinary moments, repeated often enough that the body started believing what the mind still questioned.

Rai texting before a hard day.

Rai replying when he felt like disappearing.

Rai showing up on time.

Rai admitting when he didn't know what to say instead of pretending he did.

Nadia, slowly, letting her shoulders drop around him.

Nadia, slowly, speaking her needs without apologizing.

Nadia, slowly, allowing her heart to sit in the same room as hope without immediately bracing for impact.

They moved like that for months.

Slow.

Deliberate.

Sometimes awkward.

Sometimes tender.

Sometimes painful.

There were still moments when old wounds flared.

A missed text.

A tone that sounded too sharp.

A day Rai was too tired and went quiet for longer than Nadia could tolerate.

Those moments would have shattered them before.

Now, they became test points.

Because Rai would come back and say, "I shut down. I'm sorry. I'm here."

And Nadia would say, "I'm scared. I need you to tell me when you're overwhelmed."

And they would breathe.

And try again.

Not because it was easy.

Because they had finally learned that love wasn't a feeling you protected.

It was a practice you maintained.

***

The day the conversation finally turned into a decision happened on an evening that looked like nothing.

No anniversary.

No holiday.

Just a Tuesday.

Nadia met Rai after work at a small café near Paya Lebar, one of those places that stayed bright even after sunset, where the tables were too close and the air smelled like pastries and espresso.

She arrived first.

Rai arrived seven minutes later, hair slightly damp from a sudden drizzle outside, carrying two umbrellas.

He set one down by her chair and slid into the seat across from her.

"Sorry," he said. "Rain."

Nadia's mouth curved faintly. "You always apologize."

Rai's eyes softened. "I'm trying to stop."

Nadia stared at him.

He looked tired.

Not exhausted.

Just… worn in the way people looked when they had been trying to be better and knew it wasn't glamorous.

Rai took a slow sip of his coffee.

Then he set the cup down.

He looked at Nadia for a long moment.

Nadia felt her chest tighten.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" she asked softly.

Rai's throat moved.

"I had a session today," he said.

Nadia's fingers tightened around her cup. "Heavy?"

Rai nodded once.

Nadia didn't push.

She waited.

Rai took a slow breath.

"My therapist asked me something," he said.

"What?"

Rai's gaze held hers.

He looked… afraid.

Not of her.

Of the truth.

"She asked me what I was still trying to earn," he said.

Nadia's brow furrowed.

Rai continued, voice low. "And I realized… I've spent my whole life trying to earn the right to be loved by being useful."

Nadia's chest tightened.

Rai's fingers curled slightly on the table. "And when you left, it confirmed the worst thing I believed about myself."

Nadia's throat tightened.

"What?" she whispered.

Rai's voice turned rougher. "That if I couldn't perform perfectly, I'd be abandoned."

Nadia's breath caught.

Rai stared down at his hands.

"I didn't know I believed that," he admitted. "I thought I was just… disciplined. Responsible. But it was fear. It was always fear."

Nadia swallowed hard.

She reached for her cup and took a sip, more to steady herself than because she wanted tea.

Rai looked up.

His eyes held hers with a steadiness that felt new.

"And I don't want to live like that anymore," he said.

Nadia's chest tightened.

Rai continued, voice quiet but firm. "I don't want to love you like a job. Like something I can fail."

Nadia's breath hitched.

He said her.

Not vaguely.

Not indirectly.

You.

Nadia's throat tightened.

Rai leaned forward slightly.

"I want to love you like a choice," he said.

A choice.

Again and again.

Nadia's eyes burned.

She looked down quickly, blinking.

She could feel her defenses rising.

The old fear: *If you believe him, you will hurt again.*

Rai's voice softened.

"I'm not asking you to forgive the past," he said. "I'm not asking you to jump into anything. I just…"

His throat moved.

"I want to know if you want to sit beside me again," he finished quietly.

Nadia's chest tightened.

The motif landed in her like a familiar ache.

Seat.

Beside.

Empty.

Reserved.

A place offered.

She stared at him.

His eyes were steady.

No pressure.

No manipulation.

Just a man asking for the chance to be chosen.

Nadia swallowed hard.

She didn't answer immediately.

Because if she answered too quickly, it would be too emotional.

Too impulsive.

Too dangerous.

Instead, she asked the hardest question.

"What happens if you shut down again?"

Rai didn't flinch.

He nodded once.

"Then I tell you," he said. "I don't disappear. I don't punish you with silence. I tell you I'm overwhelmed, and I come back when I can talk."

Nadia's throat tightened.

"And if I panic?" she asked.

Rai's eyes softened. "Then you tell me. And I listen."

Nadia's chest tightened.

She stared at him.

She remembered the wedding.

The chair reserved for someone absent.

The way absence could be devotion.

She remembered her own life after leaving.

The way she had built peace by keeping love at a distance.

She remembered the way Rai had shown up since.

Week after week.

Not perfectly.

But honestly.

Nadia's throat tightened.

"Rai," she whispered.

He held her gaze.

Nadia took a slow breath.

"I want to try," she said.

The words were quiet.

But they landed like something heavy and real.

Rai's breath caught.

His eyes glistened faintly.

He didn't smile widely.

He just exhaled, as if relief had loosened something deep in his bones.

"Okay," he whispered.

Nadia's mouth tightened.

Not okay.

A beginning.

She reached across the table.

Not fast.

Not dramatic.

She simply placed her hand over his.

Warm contact.

Rai froze.

Then his fingers turned, slowly, to hold hers properly.

His thumb brushed lightly over the back of her hand.

A small, careful stroke.

Nadia's chest ached.

She looked at him.

His gaze was on her hand, not her face.

As if he was afraid to look up and discover she had changed her mind.

Nadia squeezed his hand gently.

Rai lifted his eyes.

They held each other's gaze.

No fireworks.

Just quiet certainty settling between them.

***

That weekend, they went back to the resort.

Not for a wedding.

Just for a day trip.

It was Nadia's idea.

She didn't know why she needed it.

Maybe because she wanted to prove to herself that places didn't own their pain.

Maybe because she wanted to see if the air there still felt like a bruise.

Maybe because she wanted to rewrite the memory with something gentler.

They arrived in the late afternoon.

The lawn was empty now.

No floral arch.

No white chairs.

No laughter.

Just grass, sun, and the sea beyond.

They walked slowly along the edge of the ceremony area.

Nadia's steps were careful.

Rai's were steady.

They didn't talk much.

They didn't need to.

When they reached the spot where the front row had been, Nadia stopped.

She stared at the grass.

No trace of chairs.

No trace of vows.

Only the faint memory her body still carried.

Rai stood beside her.

Not touching.

Present.

Nadia exhaled.

"I remember the reserved seat," she said softly.

Rai nodded once. "Yeah."

Nadia swallowed. "It made me think about what we do with absence."

Rai's throat moved.

Nadia continued, voice quiet. "I treated what happened between us like something I had to lock away to survive. But it didn't go away. It just… waited."

Rai's eyes softened.

"I waited too," he admitted.

Nadia's chest tightened.

She glanced at him.

His expression held no accusation.

Just truth.

Nadia drew a slow breath.

"Come," she said.

She walked toward the edge of the lawn.

There, beneath a small tree near the path, was a bench.

A simple wooden bench, facing the sea.

Two seats.

Empty.

Nadia sat.

She left the space beside her open.

Rai stood for a moment, looking at the bench as if it was a decision.

Then, slowly, he sat beside her.

The wood creaked softly.

Their shoulders were close.

Not touching.

But present.

The sea glinted.

The breeze moved through leaves.

For a moment, Nadia simply breathed.

Then Rai spoke, quietly.

"I used to think love was something you prove," he said. "By being useful. By not being a burden."

Nadia stared at the horizon.

Rai continued, voice low. "But I'm learning… love is also something you accept. Even when it feels scary."

Nadia's throat tightened.

She turned slightly.

Rai's gaze was on the sea.

His face looked calm.

But there was tension in his jaw.

The effort of staying open.

Nadia reached for his hand.

Not dramatic.

Just… gentle.

Rai's fingers curled around hers.

They sat like that in silence.

No vows.

No audience.

No music.

Just two people, finally choosing to occupy the same space.

Nadia leaned her head lightly against his shoulder.

Rai stiffened for a beat--old instinct.

Then he relaxed.

Slowly.

Carefully.

His head tilted slightly toward hers.

A quiet acceptance.

Nadia closed her eyes.

The warmth of his shoulder felt like a memory.

But it was real.

Rai's voice came soft.

"I'm here," he whispered.

Nadia's chest tightened.

She answered, equally soft.

"I know."

The sun lowered.

Light turned gold.

The sea shone.

The bench held them.

Two seats.

No longer empty.

Not perfect.

Not guaranteed.

But occupied.

Chosen.

As the breeze moved and the sky softened, Nadia felt the question that had haunted her begin to quiet.

Not fully.

But enough.

This wasn't fate forcing them back into each other's orbit.

This wasn't a wedding seating chart being cruel.

This was two people, older now, finally learning how to stay without losing themselves.

Nadia opened her eyes.

She looked at the sea.

She thought of the seats they had left empty for years--

not just chairs at weddings,

but the empty spaces in their lives,

the conversations they never had,

the tenderness they never allowed.

Now, slowly, they were filling them.

With words.

With boundaries.

With hands held carefully.

With the kind of love that didn't demand perfection.

Just presence.

And as the sun dipped lower, Nadia made a quiet vow--not spoken to any officiant, not written on any paper.

A vow to herself.

To Rai.

To the seat beside her.

If they were going to try again--

they would do it properly.

Not by pretending nothing hurt.

But by staying anyway.

By making space.

By choosing.

Again.

And again.
