### Epilogue Part 4 -- Red Thread

Jeonju looked the same.

And completely different.

The same curved hanok roofs.

The same narrow paths.

The same winter air that made breath visible.

But now, Aleem walked through it with Mina's hand in his pocket.

Not as a stranger.

Not as a fan.

As hers.

Mina wore a hanbok today--soft colors that made her look like she belonged to the village's old beauty.

Aleem wore one too, grumbling at first until Mina smiled and told him he looked "handsome."

He'd stopped grumbling immediately.

ABIX weren't with them.

That was what Aleem had said.

"Just us," he'd promised Mina.

"A cute date," Mina had said, eyes bright.

"Yes," Aleem had said, too steady.

Too calm.

Mina had narrowed her eyes playfully.

"You're planning something," she'd accused.

Aleem had deadpanned.

"No."

Mina had leaned in.

"Say it properly," she'd teased.

Aleem had sighed.

"No properly," he'd said.

Mina had laughed.

Then slid their hands into his coat pocket anyway like she owned it.

Aleem's heart had been racing since.

--

They did everything they had done at the beginning.

Arcade.

Photo booth.

Street snacks.

Mina insisted on the same hotteok stall.

"This one," she declared. "It's fate."

Aleem blinked.

"Fate?" he repeated.

Mina's eyes crinkled.

"Yes," she said. "Jeonju fate."

Aleem's chest fluttered.

He tried to act normal.

He failed.

They took photos in hanbok near a small garden area where bare winter trees stood like delicate ink strokes.

Mina posed, laughing softly when Aleem tried to look serious.

"Stop," she said, tugging his sleeve. "Smile."

Aleem frowned. "I am smiling."

Mina stared at his face.

Then laughed harder.

"That's not smile," she teased.

Aleem sighed.

"It's my smile."

Mina tilted her head.

"Okay," she whispered, soft now, "then I like your smile."

Aleem's heart nearly collapsed.

He stared.

Mina's eyes widened.

"What?" she asked.

Aleem swallowed.

"You're unfair," he muttered.

Mina's lips curved.

"Good," she whispered.

Aleem groaned quietly.

Mina giggled.

Then leaned into him like it was natural.

They walked slowly through the hanok village.

Tourists passed.

Phones lifted.

A few people recognized Mina.

But it wasn't chaos.

It was just… life.

And Mina didn't flinch like she used to.

Because Aleem stayed close.

Because their hands stayed hidden.

Because she had learned she could breathe.

Mina looked up at him.

"Aleem," she said softly.

"Mm?"

Mina's eyes were bright.

"Say it," she whispered.

Aleem exhaled.

"I choose you," he murmured.

Mina's smile softened.

"Properly," she reminded.

Aleem's mouth curved.

"Properly," he promised.

Mina's cheeks warmed.

She leaned closer, voice private.

"You always say it," she murmured. "Like you never get tired."

Aleem's throat went tight.

"I don't get tired," he said. "I get… more sure."

Mina froze.

Then her eyes shimmered.

"You're dangerous," she whispered.

Aleem blinked. "Because I'm sincere?"

Mina nodded.

"Yes," she whispered. "Because you make me believe."

Aleem's chest tightened.

He wanted to kiss her right there.

He wanted to pull her closer.

He wanted to give her everything.

Instead, he took a breath.

And guided her toward the garden.

"Come," he said, voice calm.

Mina narrowed her eyes.

"You're doing it again," she accused.

"Doing what?" Aleem asked, too innocent.

"Being calm," Mina said. "It's suspicious."

Aleem huffed a laugh.

"Is calm suspicious now?"

"Yes," Mina said firmly. "With you."

Aleem's heart pounded.

He stopped near the center of the garden where the light fell prettily on pale stones and winter branches.

It was quiet.

Not empty.

Just… respectful.

A place where moments could happen without being stolen.

Mina looked around.

Then back at him.

"What is this?" she asked softly.

Aleem swallowed.

He reached into his coat pocket.

Not for her hand.

For something else.

Mina's eyes widened.

"Aleem," she whispered.

Aleem looked at her.

His voice came out steady only because he forced it.

"Mina," he said.

Mina's breath caught.

Then--because Mina was Mina--she tried to tease her way out of fear.

"Say it properly," she whispered.

Aleem huffed a breath.

"Okay," he said.

Mina blinked.

Aleem stepped closer.

He held her gaze.

"I choose you," he said.

Mina's eyes shimmered.

"Properly," she whispered, voice breaking.

Aleem nodded.

"Properly," he said.

Then he did the thing he'd been holding inside him since Jeonju first humbled him and gifted him her face turning on a roadside.

He dropped to one knee.

Mina froze.

Hands flew to her mouth.

Her whole body went still like the world had stopped.

Aleem opened the small box.

A ring caught the winter light.

Simple.

Elegant.

Like it had been designed for her hand specifically.

Mina made a small, broken sound.

"Aleem," she whispered.

Aleem's voice was low.

"I know you're scared of being collected," he said gently. "So I'm not asking to keep you like a story."

Mina's tears spilled instantly.

Aleem swallowed.

"I'm asking to build a life with you," he said. "A boring life. A safe life. A life where you can breathe."

Mina shook her head like she couldn't handle it.

Aleem's eyes softened.

"And I promise," he said, "you'll never have to perform love for me."

Mina cried harder.

Aleem's throat tightened.

He held up the ring slightly.

His voice trembled for the first time.

"Will you marry me?"

Mina stared at him like she was about to break.

Then the garden exploded.

"SURPRISE!"

Mina jolted.

Heads popped out from behind the garden wall.

Crystal--of course--was first, practically vibrating.

Isabelle stood beside her, smiling so softly it looked like she might cry too.

Ivan was there, calm as always, but his eyes were warm.

Mina's friends were there too--Airi squealing into her hands, Jun grinning like he'd been waiting for this moment his whole life.

Mina turned back to Aleem, eyes wide.

"You--" she whispered.

Aleem blinked innocently.

"What?"

Mina stared at the crowd.

Then back at Aleem.

"You lied," she whispered.

Aleem's mouth curved.

"Yes," he admitted. "Properly."

Crystal screamed.

"HE DID IT!"

Isabelle whispered, "Oh my God," hands clasped.

Ivan muttered, "Contained," but his mouth lifted slightly.

Mina's hands flew to her face.

She was crying and laughing at the same time.

"Aleem," she whispered, voice shaking, "you planned this?"

Aleem nodded.

"ABIX threatened me," he said quietly.

Crystal yelled, "WE DID."

Mina laughed through tears.

Then her voice went small.

"You… you really want to marry me?" she whispered.

Aleem's chest tightened.

"I've never been more sure," he said.

Mina swallowed.

"Say it," she whispered.

Aleem's eyes softened.

"I choose you," he said.

Mina's lips trembled.

"Properly," she whispered.

Aleem nodded.

"Properly," he promised.

Mina stared at him.

Then she nodded.

Once.

Twice.

Harder.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal screamed like a siren.

Isabelle covered her mouth, crying.

Airi collapsed into Jun.

Ivan exhaled slowly like he'd been holding his breath.

Aleem's eyes blurred.

He didn't let himself break.

Not yet.

He took the ring with careful fingers.

"Can I?" he whispered.

Mina held out her trembling hand.

"Yes," she whispered.

Aleem slid the ring onto her finger.

Perfect fit.

Mina stared at it like it wasn't real.

Then she looked at Aleem.

Her eyes were full of tears.

Full of gratitude.

Full of love that had nowhere else to go.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Aleem swallowed.

"For what?"

Mina's voice broke.

"For choosing me like I'm… just a person," she whispered.

Aleem's chest shattered softly.

He stood.

He cupped her face carefully--gloves and all--thumbs brushing her cheeks.

"You are," he whispered. "You're Mina. That's enough."

Mina sobbed.

Aleem leaned in.

He kissed her.

Not careful this time.

Not shy.

Not just warmth.

A kiss that was sweet and passionate and real.

A kiss that said: *I'm staying. Forever.*

The crowd screamed.

Crystal nearly ascended.

Isabelle laughed through tears.

Ivan shook his head like he couldn't believe this was real life.

Mina clutched Aleem's coat.

Aleem held her like she was his only certainty.

When they finally pulled apart, Mina's forehead rested against his.

Her voice was tiny.

"You chose me," she whispered.

Aleem's voice was lower.

"Properly," he promised.

Mina laughed, crying.

"Okay," she whispered.

Aleem smiled.

"Okay," he echoed.

And in the city where they first got lost--where a roadside tteokbokki and a dramatic turn had changed everything--

they found their way.

Together.
