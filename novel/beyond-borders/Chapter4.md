### Chapter 4 — Epicentre

The room released them the way a storm did—suddenly, with a rush of warmth and noise and relief.

The exit door opened into the lobby, and the contrast was almost violent: bright overhead lights, a cheerful pop song playing somewhere behind the counter, the smell of instant coffee, a staff member smiling like they hadn’t just watched eight people nearly lose their souls to a haunted doll.

Crystal stumbled out first, arms raised like she’d survived war.

“WE DID IT.”

Isabelle followed, laughing softly, cheeks flushed. “You screamed.”

“I did not scream,” Crystal said immediately.

Ivan’s voice came from behind them, calm and merciless. “You screamed.”

Mina’s friends spilled out next, chattering excitedly. Mina came last—still composed, still the calm center of her own body, but with a softness around her mouth that hadn’t been there earlier.

Aleem noticed it.

He noticed everything.

Which was a problem.

Because noticing Mina had become… automatic.

He caught himself watching the way she brushed her hair behind her ear as she stepped into the light. The way her coat collar was slightly crooked, like she’d tugged at it once in the dark and forgotten to fix it. The way she exhaled, slow, like she’d been holding her breath for longer than the escape room.

Aleem looked away.

*Stop.*

Crystal bounced toward the counter where the staff were already preparing the obligatory photo moment.

“Photo!” she announced, as if photos were a human right.

The staff member grinned and lifted a tablet. “Yes! Group photo!”

Mina’s friends cheered. ABIX cheered too.

Aleem didn’t cheer.

He just… stood.

Because he suddenly felt the weight of what a photo meant.

Not to him.

To Mina.

A photo was proof. A photo was something that could escape a room even if you didn’t want it to.

He glanced at Mina.

Her expression didn’t change, but he saw the micro-shift in her eyes. The faint tightening at the corners. A practiced steadiness settling over her like a second coat.

Not fear exactly.

Preparation.

Her friends were already moving around her, naturally—one adjusting her hood, another stepping slightly to shield her from a direct angle.

It was so smooth it almost looked casual.

Aleem felt something tighten in his chest.

This was what people didn’t see.

Not the stage.

The aftermath.

The way even a simple photo required strategy.

Crystal called out, “Aleem! Mina! Center!”

Aleem’s head snapped up.

Mina’s friends immediately echoed it, laughing, nudging.

“Center, center!”

“Together, together!”

Isabelle gave Aleem a look that said *don’t fight it.*

Ivan, on the other hand, looked like he was analyzing probabilities.

Aleem opened his mouth to protest.

Nothing came out.

Because Mina had already taken one small step forward.

As if she’d decided.

Aleem followed before he could stop himself.

They ended up standing at the epicentre of the group—not because anyone forced them now, but because the crowd of friends naturally curved around them like a tide.

Crystal leaned in on Aleem’s left. Mina’s friends clustered on Mina’s right.

Aleem was aware of Mina’s presence beside him in an almost painful way.

Not touching.

But close.

Close enough that warmth existed between their coats.

The staff member held up the tablet.

“One, two—smile!”

Aleem smiled on reflex.

Mina smiled too.

And for a fraction of a second, it looked like a perfectly normal group photo.

A bunch of friends who’d survived a silly haunted room.

Just that.

The shutter sound clicked.

Everyone erupted into laughter and commentary.

Crystal immediately demanded to see it.

Mina’s friends crowded around too.

Aleem hung back half a step, letting the chaos wash past him.

He didn’t need to see the photo.

He already knew what it would look like.

It would look like fate.

And fate was dangerous.

—

They stepped outside.

The Jeonju air hit them again—cold and clean, with the faint smell of street food drifting from somewhere nearby.

Crystal was still buzzing. “Okay. Lunch. We need lunch. I am starving from fear.”

Isabelle nodded. “I could eat a house.”

Mina’s friends were discussing something in rapid Japanese. Mina responded quietly, then looked up.

“I know a place,” she said in English. “Near here. Bibimbap. Good.”

Crystal’s eyes widened. “Jeonju bibimbap with Mina? God has favorites.”

Ivan cleared his throat.

Crystal shut her mouth immediately, like she’d been remotely muted.

Mina blinked, then laughed softly. “Your friend is… funny.”

Isabelle smiled. “She’s always like this.”

Mina’s lips curved. “I like.”

Aleem forced his brain to stay functional.

“Let’s go,” he said.

They began walking.

It should’ve been simple.

A street.

A group.

Lunch.

But Aleem couldn’t shake the unease that had latched onto him the moment the camera came out.

Not because he was scared for himself.

Because he was suddenly hyper-aware of the world.

The way the street widened into an open area.

The way pedestrians turned their heads.

The way some eyes lingered longer than others.

They weren’t being chased.

No one screamed.

No one pointed.

But recognition was a quiet thing.

It didn’t need noise to be dangerous.

As they crossed a small intersection, Aleem saw it.

A teenager on the opposite sidewalk, phone lifted—not fully obvious, but angled just slightly too high. The way their eyes darted between Mina and the screen.

A whisper to a friend.

A hand covering a mouth.

Aleem’s pulse shifted.

He didn’t turn to look at Mina.

He didn’t want to alert her unless it became certain.

But his body moved on instinct anyway.

He stepped subtly to the side, adjusting his position so that, from that angle, his shoulder blocked a clear view of Mina’s face.

He did it like it was nothing.

Like it was just how he walked.

Crystal continued talking, oblivious. Mina’s friends continued laughing.

Mina continued walking.

And then—like she had felt the shift in space—Mina’s gaze slid to Aleem.

Her eyes narrowed slightly.

Not suspicion.

Understanding.

Aleem kept his face neutral.

He didn’t glance toward the teenager.

He didn’t point.

He just continued walking, creating a small corridor of cover without making it dramatic.

Mina’s expression softened.

She didn’t say anything.

But the way she exhaled—quiet, controlled—told him she’d noticed too.

That she’d lived with this long enough to recognize when someone was trying to help.

They reached the corner.

The teenager lowered the phone.

The moment passed.

Aleem’s shoulders loosened by a fraction.

Then Crystal’s voice cut through the air.

“Aleem!” she called, loud.

Aleem’s spine went rigid.

Mina’s head turned slightly.

Crystal ran ahead a few steps, pointing toward a small shop front. “That one! It looks good!”

Aleem exhaled.

Not a threat.

Just Crystal being Crystal.

Still.

His heart took a moment to forgive her.

—

The bibimbap place was warm, filled with the sound of sizzling stone bowls and conversation. They were seated in a semi-private corner—partly by luck, partly because Mina’s friends guided them there with subtle efficiency.

Aleem watched it happen again.

Small adjustments.

A preference for corners.

Seats that faced the entrance.

A hood casually placed near Mina.

This wasn’t paranoia.

This was survival.

They ordered quickly.

Crystal took over the process like she was born to be a menu translator. Isabelle helped with polite Korean phrases. Ivan was quiet, attentive.

Mina spoke to the server in Korean without effort.

Aleem listened again, proud in the same quiet way.

Then the food came.

Stone bowls set down steaming, colors bright against the winter outside—greens, carrots, egg yolk like sunlight.

Crystal practically cried. “Jeonju bibimbap is REAL.”

They began eating.

For a while, it was just… normal.

Laughing.

Chopsticks clinking.

Warmth.

Aleem almost let himself relax.

Then he saw it.

A reflection in the restaurant window.

Someone outside pausing.

A phone lifted.

Aleem’s hand tightened around his spoon.

He didn’t look up too fast.

He didn’t want Mina to see his reaction first.

But Mina’s friends had already noticed.

One of them leaned toward Mina, whispering.

Mina’s eyes flicked briefly to the window.

Then back down.

Her expression didn’t change.

But something in her shoulders stiffened.

Aleem’s chest tightened.

He hated it.

He hated that even here—warm, private, safe—there was still a world outside hungry for her.

He didn’t know what the correct move was.

He wasn’t staff.

He wasn’t security.

He was just… Aleem.

Single among attached friends.

A guy who liked escape rooms.

A guy who once watched a girl sing from far away and never expected to share bibimbap with her in a quiet Jeonju restaurant.

But he did know one thing:

He refused to let her be alone in it.

Aleem shifted his body slightly again, angle adjusting so that, from the window, his shoulder and head obscured Mina’s face more.

He picked up his water cup, lifted it in a natural movement that happened to block a clean shot.

Then he leaned toward the table and spoke, casual, as if he was only continuing the conversation.

“So,” he said, voice steady. “What made you guys choose this escape room?”

Mina blinked.

She looked at him.

And then, slowly, the tension in her shoulders loosened.

Her lips curved.

“A friend recommendation,” she answered, playing along.

Her gaze stayed on him a second longer than necessary.

Not a fan gaze.

Not a celebrity gaze.

Just… a look.

A private acknowledgement.

Aleem’s heart fluttered once, sharp and stupid.

Crystal, unaware of anything, piped up. “Because we’re insane.”

Everyone laughed.

Even Mina.

And when Aleem glanced again at the window, the person outside had moved on.

The world had lost interest.

For now.

Aleem kept his face calm.

But inside, something had changed.

Because he’d done it without thinking.

Shielded her.

Not like a hero.

Not like a fan.

Like a man who simply couldn’t stand the idea of her carrying that weight alone.

Mina took another bite of bibimbap, then spoke quietly.

“You notice fast,” she said.

Aleem’s throat tightened.

He didn’t pretend not to understand.

He nodded once.

“Yeah,” he said. “I do.”

Mina’s eyes softened.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

Aleem’s fingers tightened around his spoon.

He kept his expression steady.

Because if he let himself react too much, he was afraid it would show.

How much those two words mattered.

How much he wanted—suddenly, irrationally—to keep earning them.

Outside, Jeonju continued being Jeonju: quiet streets, winter light, people living their lives.

Inside, the table buzzed with laughter and warmth.

And in the epicentre of it all, Aleem realized something with a clarity that scared him:

This wasn’t just a strange, lucky encounter anymore.

It was becoming… a responsibility.

A choice.

And he wasn’t sure when he’d decided it.

Only that he already had.

He would keep her safe.

Not because she needed saving.

But because she deserved to breathe.

Even for a moment.

Even here.

Even now.
