# Chapter 24 -- The Reveal

They didn't do it in a fancy restaurant.

They didn't do it in a dramatic group trip.

They didn't do it over a long, emotional speech.

They did it the ABIX way.

Messy.

Casual.

With snacks.

And a disaster waiting to happen.

The timing forced their hand.

Crystal didn't let the "talking to someone" thing go.

Not for a day.

Not for a week.

Not even for a single hour.

She brought it up every time ABIX met.

Sometimes subtly.

Sometimes not.

Sometimes with the subtlety of a megaphone.

"Belle," she would say brightly, "how's your *colleague*?"

Ivan would stare.

Isabelle would die.

Aleem would sip his drink like his soul had left his body.

It became unbearable.

And more importantly--

it became risky.

Because the more Crystal dug, the more likely she'd stumble onto Aleem.

And when that happened, it wouldn't be a reveal.

It would be a betrayal.

So on a quiet Saturday afternoon, after Isabelle's asatizah session and after Aleem's work errands, they agreed.

Today.

They would tell ABIX.

Before ABIX found out.

They chose a simple place.

A café near their usual hangout.

Not too romantic.

Not too quiet.

Somewhere ABIX already felt comfortable.

Somewhere the conversation could happen without looking like an intervention.

Crystal arrived first, as always.

She claimed a big table.

Ivan arrived second, looking tired.

He put his bag down like he was surrendering to life.

Then Isabelle arrived.

Heart pounding.

Hands slightly cold.

Her smile too tight.

Crystal's eyes lit up.

"OHO," she said immediately. "Look at her face. Serious meeting."

Isabelle laughed weakly.

Ivan stared.

"Why are we meeting?" he asked.

Isabelle swallowed.

"Because… we need to tell you something," she said.

Crystal gasped.

Ivan sighed.

Crystal leaned forward dramatically.

"IS IT THE SECRET ROMANCE?" she demanded.

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

"Yes," Isabelle admitted.

Crystal slapped the table.

"I KNEW IT."

Ivan's eyes narrowed.

He didn't look excited.

He looked… cautious.

"Okay," Ivan said slowly. "Who is it?"

Isabelle's heart hammered.

She glanced toward the café entrance.

Aleem was not here yet.

That was part of the plan.

Isabelle wanted to speak first.

Because she didn't want ABIX to think Aleem "took" her.

She wanted it clear.

She chose.

Isabelle swallowed.

"It's… someone you know," she said.

Crystal's eyes widened.

"ABIX?" she whispered.

Ivan frowned.

"Someone we know," he repeated, suspicious.

Isabelle nodded.

Crystal clutched her chest.

"DON'T TELL ME IT'S SOMEONE FROM OUR FRIEND GROUP."

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Ivan's gaze sharpened.

"Is it… Aleem?" Ivan asked.

Isabelle froze.

Crystal's mouth dropped.

"HUH?"

Ivan stared at Isabelle.

His eyes were too sharp.

Too observant.

He had already suspected.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She nodded slowly.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal's scream didn't happen immediately.

For a second, she just stared like her brain had crashed.

Then:

"WHAT?!"

Half the café turned.

Ivan winced.

"Lower your voice," he muttered.

Crystal ignored him.

"ISABELLE," she hissed, leaning forward like a detective, "YOU'RE DATING ALEEM?"

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal's eyes widened.

"But… but… ALEEM?"

Ivan sighed.

"Crystal," he said, "stop acting like Aleem is a stranger."

Crystal stared at Ivan.

"It's not that!" she whispered fiercely. "It's… it's… it's…"

She waved her hands helplessly.

"It's ABIX," she finally spat.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

"I know," Isabelle whispered.

Crystal pointed accusingly.

"And you didn't tell me?"

Isabelle's voice shook.

"I was scared," she admitted.

Crystal's eyes narrowed.

"Scared of what?"

Isabelle swallowed.

"That it would change ABIX," she whispered. "That you would think I ruined the group."

Crystal went quiet.

Ivan's gaze softened slightly.

Crystal's anger flickered.

Then Crystal said, quieter,

"Did he ask you out?"

Isabelle shook her head.

"No," she whispered. "I confessed first."

Crystal froze.

Ivan's brows rose slightly.

Crystal stared.

"You confessed?" she repeated.

Isabelle nodded.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal looked shocked.

Not because Isabelle was incapable.

Because Isabelle was the cautious one.

The INFJ.

The one who kept her heart locked.

Isabelle swallowed.

"I didn't plan to," she admitted. "It just… happened."

Crystal's eyes flickered.

"And Aleem?" Crystal asked. "What did he do?"

Isabelle's throat tightened.

"He asked for time," she said. "Then he said yes."

Crystal stared.

Then she scoffed.

"Of course he asked for time," she muttered. "Mr Logical."

Ivan's lips twitched.

"Accurate," he said.

Isabelle's cheeks warmed.

Despite the anxiety, she almost smiled.

Then Crystal's face tightened again.

"How long have you been hiding?" she demanded.

Isabelle swallowed.

"Since Hokkaido," she admitted.

Crystal's jaw dropped.

"HOKKAIDO?!"

Ivan closed his eyes.

Crystal looked personally betrayed.

"YOU WENT OVERSEAS," she whispered, scandalized, "AND CAME BACK COUPLE?"

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

"We didn't--"

Crystal pointed.

"DON'T EXPLAIN," she snapped. "I NEED TIME."

Ivan sighed.

"You're being dramatic," he said.

Crystal whipped her head.

"YOU'RE NOT SHOCKED?!" she demanded.

Ivan shrugged.

"I am," he admitted. "But it makes sense."

Crystal stared.

"Makes sense?" she repeated.

Ivan nodded.

"You two have always been closest," he said. "Same vibe. Same quiet intensity. Same… weird emotional depth."

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

Crystal looked like she wanted to argue.

But she couldn't.

Because Ivan was right.

Crystal huffed.

"I hate that you're right," she muttered.

Ivan smirked.

"Story of your life," he said.

Crystal kicked him under the table.

Ivan hissed.

Isabelle almost laughed.

But then the door opened.

Aleem walked in.

Isabelle's heart pounded.

Aleem scanned the café.

He spotted their table.

He walked over.

His face was calm.

But Isabelle noticed the tension in his jaw.

He was nervous.

Just hiding it well.

Aleem stopped beside Isabelle.

He nodded to Crystal.

He nodded to Ivan.

"Hey," he said.

Crystal stared at him like he was a criminal.

Ivan stared at him like he was a puzzle.

Aleem sat down.

Across.

Still respectful.

He didn't put an arm around Isabelle.

He didn't touch her.

He kept boundaries.

Even now.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Aleem looked at Crystal.

Then at Ivan.

His voice was calm.

"I assume Belle told you," he said.

Crystal's voice was sharp.

"YES," she hissed. "She told us you're HER SECRET BOYFRIEND."

Aleem blinked.

"Not secret forever," he said carefully.

Crystal pointed.

"WHY DID YOU HIDE?" she demanded.

Aleem nodded slowly.

"Because we needed time," he said. "And because we didn't want to change ABIX without being sure."

Crystal scoffed.

"You think ABIX will break because you date?" she snapped.

Aleem's gaze held hers.

"No," he said. "But I think ABIX deserves respect. And I didn't want to treat your friendship like something I could gamble with."

Crystal froze.

The answer disarmed her.

Because it wasn't an excuse.

It was principle.

Ivan watched Aleem closely.

Then Ivan spoke.

"You serious?" he asked.

Aleem nodded.

"Yes," he said.

Ivan's eyes narrowed.

"Proper serious," Ivan added.

Aleem nodded again.

"Yes," he said. "Proper."

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Proper.

That word again.

Crystal stared.

Then she said, quieter,

"Are you going to hurt her?"

The café noise seemed to dim.

Isabelle's breath caught.

Aleem's gaze softened.

His answer was quiet.

"No," he said. "And if I ever become someone who does, I hope you'll stop me."

Crystal's eyes filled.

She blinked hard.

Then she slapped the table again.

"OKAY," she declared loudly, "I'M STILL ANGRY."

Ivan sighed.

Crystal continued.

"But," she said, voice tightening, "I'm also… happy. Because Belle… you look better."

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Crystal's eyes shone.

"And Aleem," she added, pointing, "you better keep her like that."

Aleem nodded.

"I will try," he said.

Crystal scoffed.

"TRY?!"

Ivan muttered, "Ignore her."

Crystal turned to Isabelle suddenly.

"And you," she said. "No more hiding. If you cry, you tell us. If you struggle, you tell us. Don't carry alone."

Isabelle's eyes burned.

She nodded.

"Okay," she whispered.

Ivan leaned back.

His voice was quieter.

"I'm not happy you hid," he admitted. "But I get it. You're cautious."

Isabelle swallowed.

Ivan continued.

"Just… don't let this ruin the group," he said.

Isabelle nodded.

"It won't," she whispered.

Aleem's voice came low.

"It won't," he echoed.

The four of them sat in silence for a moment.

Not awkward.

Just… absorbing.

The secret season ended.

ABIX now knew.

The world didn't explode.

Crystal didn't disown Isabelle.

Ivan didn't vanish.

Aleem didn't look smug.

Isabelle didn't collapse.

They were still ABIX.

Just… slightly altered.

Like a song with a new harmony.

Crystal suddenly sniffed.

"Okay," she announced, wiping her eyes aggressively, "NOW WE CELEBRATE."

Ivan groaned. "Why?"

Crystal snapped, "BECAUSE LOVE."

Ivan muttered, "I hate this."

Crystal pointed.

"You love this."

Ivan sighed.

Isabelle laughed.

For the first time since the hawker centre, her laughter came without fear.

Because the secret was gone.

And in its place was something stronger:

ABIX still holding.

Even with two hearts inside it beating a little closer than before.
