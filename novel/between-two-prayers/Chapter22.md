# Chapter 22 -- The Almost Slip

After the meeting with her father, Isabelle thought the hardest part would be the aftermath.

The tension at home.

Her mother's quiet eyes.

Her father's tight silences.

The heavy feeling of being watched.

She didn't expect the hardest part to be ABIX.

Because ABIX wasn't supposed to be hard.

ABIX was supposed to be safe.

But now, ABIX was a minefield made of ordinary moments.

One wrong word.

One lingering glance.

One accidental softness.

And the secret would detonate.

It happened on a Wednesday.

A normal day.

A day Isabelle didn't prepare for.

Crystal suggested a quick supper after work.

Ivan said he was tired.

Crystal called him old.

Ivan called her unemployed.

Crystal threatened to punch him.

Ivan said he'd sue.

Aleem said, "Okay."

Isabelle said, "Okay."

They met at a hawker centre.

The air smelled like smoke and noodles.

Fans whirred.

Tables were crowded.

People talked loudly.

It was perfect.

No one would notice them.

Or so Isabelle thought.

Crystal ordered first.

Ivan complained about queue logic.

Isabelle and Aleem sat at a table holding seats.

Across from each other.

Because that was safer.

Isabelle watched Aleem peel the plastic from a packet of tissue.

He offered it to her automatically.

A tiny gesture.

Old habit.

Isabelle accepted without thinking.

Their fingers brushed.

A light contact.

Less than a second.

But Isabelle's heart jumped.

Because now, touch meant something.

Aleem withdrew immediately.

His face stayed neutral.

But Isabelle noticed his jaw tighten.

Careful.

Always careful.

Isabelle looked away, pretending she didn't feel the warmth lingering on her fingertips.

When Crystal and Ivan returned, they were loud.

Crystal slammed her tray down dramatically.

"I'm starving," she announced.

Ivan sat down and muttered, "You always say that."

Crystal pointed at him. "Because I always AM."

Isabelle laughed.

Aleem's eyes softened.

Ivan noticed.

Not the softness.

Not yet.

But he noticed Aleem looking.

Ivan's gaze flicked between them.

Isabelle's stomach tightened.

Then the conversation flowed.

Work.

News.

Crystal's latest obsession.

Ivan's latest complaint.

Isabelle relaxed a little.

Maybe it was fine.

Maybe she was overthinking.

Then Crystal leaned forward suddenly.

"Eh," she said, eyes gleaming, "I have tea."

Ivan groaned. "Not again."

Crystal ignored him.

She looked at Isabelle.

"Belle," she said, "my colleague say she saw you at Bugis last week."

Isabelle froze.

Her chopsticks paused mid-air.

Aleem's posture shifted slightly.

Not panicked.

Attentive.

Crystal continued, excited.

"She said you were with someone," she added.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Ivan looked up.

His eyes narrowed.

"Who?" Ivan asked.

Isabelle's brain scrambled.

Colleague.

Bugis.

Last week.

That was the café.

The secret date.

Isabelle forced a laugh.

"Probably ABIX," she said quickly.

Crystal frowned.

"No," she said. "She said it was just you and the guy."

Isabelle's stomach dropped.

Aleem didn't move.

His face remained calm.

But Isabelle could feel his attention sharpen.

Ivan's eyes narrowed further.

"Guy?" he repeated. "What guy?"

Isabelle's mouth went dry.

Her heart hammered.

She could lie.

She could deflect.

She could joke.

Crystal's eyes were bright.

"Belle," Crystal teased, "you dating ah?"

The word *dating* hit Isabelle's chest.

Dating.

Her throat closed.

Aleem's face stayed neutral.

But Isabelle could feel him beside the table like a steady wall.

Isabelle forced herself to smile.

"No lah," she said, too quickly. "Just… meeting a friend."

Ivan's eyes narrowed.

"What friend?" he asked.

Isabelle's mind raced.

What friend did she have that ABIX didn't know?

Not many.

Isabelle swallowed.

"A colleague," she blurted.

Crystal's eyes widened.

"Ooooooooh," she sang. "Colleague."

Ivan frowned.

"You don't hang out with colleagues," he said flatly.

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Ivan was too observant.

Isabelle forced a laugh.

"Now I do," she said.

Crystal leaned in dramatically.

"Isabelle," she whispered loudly, "ARE YOU HAVING A SECRET ROMANCE?"

Ivan groaned. "Stop."

But his eyes stayed on Isabelle.

Not joking.

Assessing.

Isabelle's palms sweated.

Her mouth went dry.

She needed to end this.

She needed to shut it down before Crystal exploded into investigation mode.

Isabelle forced a casual tone.

"No," she said. "It's not like that."

Crystal pouted.

"Then why hide?" she demanded.

Isabelle's heart slammed.

Hide.

The word felt like a knife.

Because yes.

She was hiding.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Aleem finally spoke.

His voice was calm.

"Maybe she just doesn't want people to kaypoh," he said.

Crystal turned to him.

"EH," she said, "why you defending her?"

Isabelle's stomach dropped.

Aleem's expression didn't change.

He shrugged lightly.

"Because it's normal," he said. "If she wants privacy, we respect."

Ivan stared.

Crystal stared.

Isabelle's heart hammered.

Aleem's defense was reasonable.

But the timing.

The calm.

The way he stepped in like it mattered.

It was almost too protective.

Crystal narrowed her eyes.

"Hmmmmmm," she hummed.

Isabelle wanted to die.

After supper, they walked to the MRT.

Crystal kept talking about "secret romance."

Ivan kept telling her to shut up.

Isabelle walked beside them, heart pounding.

Aleem walked slightly behind.

Isabelle could feel his gaze on her back.

Not controlling.

Checking.

Are you okay.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

When they reached the gantry, Crystal suddenly grabbed Isabelle's arm.

"Belle," she said, eyes shining, "tell me the truth. Are you dating?"

Isabelle froze.

Ivan stopped walking.

Aleem stopped too.

Crowd moved around them.

But Isabelle's world narrowed.

This was it.

The moment.

The almost slip.

Isabelle's heart pounded.

She could lie.

She could break.

She could confess.

Isabelle forced herself to breathe.

In.

Out.

Then she did what she always did when she needed to survive.

She used half-truth.

"I'm… talking to someone," she admitted.

Crystal gasped.

"SEE!" she squealed. "I KNEW IT!"

Ivan's eyes narrowed.

"Who?" he demanded.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She couldn't say.

Not yet.

So she smiled weakly.

"I'll tell you when I'm sure," she said.

Crystal's jaw dropped.

"WHEN YOU'RE SURE?" she screamed.

Ivan stared.

"That means it's serious," he said quietly.

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Serious.

It was.

Isabelle nodded.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal's eyes widened.

Then she narrowed them again.

"And you went Bugis with him," she said. "And you didn't tell me."

Isabelle swallowed.

Crystal looked personally offended.

"Isabelle," she whispered dramatically, "this is betrayal."

Ivan sighed.

"Crystal," he muttered, "stop acting like she cheated on you."

Crystal snapped, "SHE DID."

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

She looked down.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

Crystal's expression softened slightly.

Just slightly.

"Is he good?" Crystal asked, quieter.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She nodded.

"Yes," she whispered.

Ivan's gaze stayed sharp.

"Why hide?" he asked.

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Because it's Aleem.

Because you'll freak out.

Because ABIX will change.

Because religion.

Because my father.

Isabelle swallowed.

"I just… needed time," she said.

Ivan stared.

He didn't look satisfied.

But he didn't push.

He only said, low,

"Okay. But don't be stupid."

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Aleem stood a few steps away.

Silent.

He didn't intervene.

Because this was Isabelle's boundary to manage.

Crystal grabbed Isabelle's hands dramatically.

"Okay," she declared. "I will give you time. But when you tell me, you tell me EVERYTHING."

Isabelle laughed weakly.

"Okay," she whispered.

Crystal smiled brightly.

"Good," she said. "Now go home. Sleep. And don't do sinful things."

Isabelle choked.

Ivan groaned.

"Why are you like this?" he muttered.

Crystal shrugged. "I'm a guardian."

Isabelle's cheeks burned.

Sinful.

If only Crystal knew how hard Aleem worked to keep boundaries.

They tapped in.

They separated at the platform.

Crystal kept looking back at Isabelle like she was plotting.

Ivan gave Isabelle one last sharp look.

Then they boarded.

Isabelle stood alone on her platform.

Her hands trembled.

Her phone buzzed.

A message from Aleem.

**Aleem:** *You okay?*

Of course.

Isabelle's eyes burned.

She typed:

**Isabelle:** *Almost got caught. I told them I'm talking to someone. I didn't say who.*

The reply came:

**Aleem:** *Okay. That's fine. We'll tell them soon.*

Isabelle swallowed.

Soon.

The word felt like both relief and dread.

Because telling ABIX meant the secret season would end.

And Isabelle wasn't sure she was ready for the group to change.

But the slip had already happened.

The secret had already started cracking.

And now, it wasn't a matter of if.

It was a matter of when.
