# Chapter 39 -- The First Prayer at Home

Isabelle didn't plan it like a rebellion.

She planned it like a breath.

One honest thing.

That was what Aleem said.

One.

Not a speech.

Not a declaration.

Not a dramatic showdown.

Just one honest thing--

so she could stop living like her faith was a secret crime.

She woke up on Sunday and checked the time without thinking.

Then she realized what she was doing.

Prayer times.

Her stomach tightened.

At home.

Home was the hardest place.

Because home was where her mother's tears lived.

Home was where her father's fear lived.

Home was where every change felt like betrayal.

Isabelle sat on her bed and pressed her palms to her eyes.

She breathed.

In.

Out.

Then she whispered,

"Bismillah."

Not dramatic.

Just steady.

In the kitchen, her mother was preparing lunch.

Chopping vegetables.

Moving quietly.

The TV in the living room played a random variety show her father liked.

A normal Sunday.

Isabelle poured water into her cup.

Her hands trembled.

She took a sip.

Then she placed the cup down.

This was it.

One honest thing.

Isabelle cleared her throat.

"Ma," she said softly.

Her mother looked up.

"Yes?"

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Her heart pounded.

She forced herself to keep her voice calm.

"I need a few minutes later," she said. "I need to pray."

Silence.

Not the normal silence.

A silence that stopped the air.

Her mother froze.

Knife paused mid-chop.

Her eyes widened.

Then her lips trembled.

Isabelle's chest tightened painfully.

The tears arrived fast.

Her mother's eyes filled.

Not loud yet.

Just shining.

Like she was trying to hold them back.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She wanted to apologize.

But she remembered.

Don't apologize like you didn't mean it.

So she stayed steady.

Her mother whispered,

"Now… you pray here?"

Isabelle swallowed.

"Yes," she whispered.

Her mother's tears spilled.

She turned away quickly.

Her shoulders shook.

Isabelle's heart cracked.

But she didn't take the sentence back.

She simply stepped forward.

She placed her hand on her mother's back.

Soft.

Gentle.

"Ma," she whispered, "I'm still here."

Her mother sobbed quietly.

"I know," she cried. "But it hurts."

Isabelle's eyes burned.

"I know," Isabelle whispered. "I know. I'm sorry it hurts."

Her mother's sobs grew.

Isabelle kept her hand on her mother's back.

Not pushing.

Not preaching.

Just staying.

After a while, her mother wiped her cheeks.

She didn't look at Isabelle.

She said, voice broken,

"Okay. Go."

Isabelle's breath caught.

Okay.

Not blessing.

But permission.

Isabelle nodded.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Her mother didn't answer.

But she didn't stop her.

Isabelle went to her room.

She closed the door quietly.

Her hands trembled as she took out her prayer garment.

A simple telekung.

White.

She had bought it with the asatizah.

She had kept it hidden in her drawer.

Not because she was ashamed.

Because she wasn't ready.

Now she took it out.

She looked at it for a moment.

White fabric.

So simple.

Yet it represented everything:

A new life.

A new practice.

A new identity.

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Then she wore it.

Her hands moved slowly.

Carefully.

Like she was learning to inhabit herself.

She laid a small prayer mat on the floor.

She checked the direction.

Qibla.

She stood.

Her heart pounded.

She whispered,

"Allahu Akbar."

Her voice trembled.

But the words were clear.

She lifted her hands.

And when she lowered them, Isabelle felt something.

Not magic.

Not ecstasy.

Something quieter.

Like her spine straightening.

She recited what she knew.

Slowly.

Carefully.

Sometimes stumbling.

Sometimes pausing.

But she continued.

Because prayer wasn't performance.

Prayer was attempt.

And God was not waiting with a marking scheme.

God was waiting with mercy.

Isabelle bowed.

Ruku'.

Her forehead touched the ground.

Sujud.

And something inside her softened.

Because this--

this wasn't happening in a safe mosque room.

It was happening in her childhood bedroom.

In the house where she learned to pray as a Christian.

Now her forehead touched the floor in another surrender.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Tears fell onto the prayer mat.

She didn't cry because she regretted.

She cried because she was carrying love and loss at the same time.

She cried because she was still her mother's daughter.

And she was also now Allah's servant.

She cried because she had stepped into truth…

and truth still hurt people you loved.

When she finished, Isabelle sat for a moment.

Breathing.

Quiet.

Then she whispered,

"Ya Allah… please soften their hearts. Please don't let love become resentment. Please let me be gentle. Please let me be good."

She wiped her face.

She removed the telekung.

Folded it neatly.

Her hands were steadier now.

Not because she wasn't scared.

Because she had done it.

One honest thing.

When Isabelle stepped out of her room, her mother was still in the kitchen.

Quiet.

Wiping dishes that were already clean.

Isabelle approached slowly.

Her mother didn't look up.

Isabelle swallowed.

"Ma," she whispered.

Her mother's shoulders tightened.

Isabelle's voice was soft.

"Thank you for letting me," she said.

Her mother sniffed.

She didn't answer.

Then, after a long silence, her mother whispered,

"Did you… feel peace?"

Isabelle froze.

The question was small.

But it cracked the grief.

It wasn't accusation.

It wasn't shame.

It was curiosity.

A mother trying to understand why her daughter chose something that hurt.

Isabelle's eyes filled.

"Yes," she whispered. "I did."

Her mother's lips trembled.

Her eyes filled again.

She whispered,

"I wish… your peace didn't cost me this pain."

Isabelle's throat tightened.

"I know," she whispered. "I'm sorry."

Her mother finally looked at her.

Red eyes.

Tired face.

Love beneath fear.

Then her mother said quietly,

"Just… don't forget us."

Isabelle's chest cracked.

She shook her head.

"I won't," she whispered.

Her mother swallowed.

Then she turned back to the sink.

Not hugging.

Not forgiving.

But trying.

In the living room, her father glanced up from the TV.

He looked at Isabelle.

He didn't ask.

But Isabelle knew he knew.

He saw the calm.

He saw the slightly swollen eyes.

He saw the change.

Her father's jaw tightened.

Then he looked away.

Nothing said.

But Isabelle felt it.

A new rule forming.

Not spoken.

Not comfortable.

But real.

She could pray at home now.

Not freely.

Not joyfully.

But she could.

One honest thing.

And after dinner, when Isabelle texted Aleem:

**Isabelle:** *I prayed at home today. I told my mom. She cried. But she let me.*

His reply came immediately.

**Aleem:** *Alhamdulillah. You did well. One step.*

One step.

Isabelle stared at the message.

Her chest heavy.

But her spine straighter.

Because she had finally done something she thought would break the house.

And the house…

didn't break.

It shook.

It hurt.

But it held.

And Isabelle realized:

This is how healing begins.

Not with comfort.

With courage.

With one honest thing.
