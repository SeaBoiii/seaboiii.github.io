# Chapter 35 -- The Second Reveal

Isabelle thought she was done with reveals.

First, the breakup.

Then the confession.

Then ABIX.

Then her parents.

Then the asatizah meeting.

She thought the hardest rooms were behind her.

But there was one more room.

Not hostile.

Not cruel.

Just… important.

Because ABIX was family too.

And family deserved the truth.

She didn't tell them in a café.

Not this time.

She didn't want strangers to overhear.

She didn't want Crystal's volume to become a public announcement.

So she invited them to her place.

A simple weekend afternoon.

Her parents were out for groceries.

Isabelle told them she wanted to study.

Not a lie.

Just not the whole truth.

She set snacks on the table.

Bought bubble tea.

Made the living room look normal.

Because if the room looked too serious, Crystal would panic.

And if Crystal panicked, she would make it worse.

Ivan arrived first.

Of course.

He stepped in, scanned the room, then scanned Isabelle's face.

"Something happened," he said.

Isabelle laughed weakly.

"It's that obvious?"

Ivan nodded.

"Yes," he said. "Your eyes are… different."

Isabelle swallowed.

Then Crystal burst in like a hurricane.

"HELLOOOO," she sang, shoes off, bag tossed, energy everywhere.

She looked at Isabelle.

Then she froze.

"…Why you look like you just survived war?"

Isabelle exhaled.

Because she kind of did.

Aleem arrived last.

Quiet.

Respectful.

He greeted them.

Then he sat slightly to Isabelle's side.

Not too close.

But near.

Ivan's eyes flicked between them.

Crystal's eyes narrowed.

She pointed.

"Okay," she said, "I know this face. This is the face before someone drops bomb."

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She nodded slowly.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal slapped her hands together.

"OKAY," she announced. "DROP IT."

Ivan leaned back.

"Go," he said.

Isabelle inhaled.

She looked at Aleem.

He nodded once.

Isabelle turned back to ABIX.

Her voice trembled.

"I converted," she said softly.

Silence.

Crystal blinked.

Ivan's eyes widened slightly.

Aleem didn't move.

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Crystal's voice came out too quiet.

"…Huh?"

Isabelle swallowed.

"I took shahada," she whispered. "Yesterday."

The silence stretched.

Then Crystal's mouth opened.

"No way," she whispered.

Ivan's eyes sharpened.

"You're sure?" he asked.

Isabelle nodded.

"Yes," she whispered.

Crystal stared.

Then she looked at Aleem.

Then she looked back at Isabelle.

Then she whispered the exact sentence Isabelle expected.

"Did you do it because of him?"

Isabelle's chest tightened.

Old fear.

New steadiness.

Isabelle shook her head.

"No," she said firmly. "I didn't."

Crystal's eyes filled.

Ivan's gaze stayed sharp.

He asked, calm,

"Explain."

Isabelle exhaled.

So she did.

Not everything.

Not the rawest parts.

But the shape.

Months of learning.

Questions.

Talking to the pastor.

Going alone.

Testing her intention.

Saying the shahada in a room where Aleem wasn't there.

Choosing truth.

Choosing God.

Her voice shook.

But it didn't collapse.

When she finished, the room was quiet.

Crystal wiped her face roughly.

"Why am I crying?" she muttered, offended by her own emotions.

Ivan didn't speak immediately.

He looked at Isabelle like he was recalibrating her.

Not judging.

Updating.

Then Ivan nodded once.

"Okay," he said.

Crystal snapped her head.

"OKAY?!"

Ivan shrugged.

"You made a decision," he said. "You did it properly. You didn't hide behind romance. You did the due diligence."

Crystal stared.

"Due diligence," she repeated, outraged.

Ivan sighed.

"You know what I mean," he said.

Crystal's eyes filled again.

She turned to Isabelle.

"Belle," she whispered, voice breaking, "are you okay?"

That question.

The most important one.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

She nodded.

"I'm… calm," she whispered. "But my mom cried. My dad was angry. It's hard."

Crystal's tears spilled.

"Aiyo," she sobbed. "Of course it's hard."

Then she stood abruptly.

Isabelle blinked.

Crystal walked over.

And before Isabelle could react, Crystal hugged her.

Hard.

Tight.

No elegance.

Just love.

Isabelle's breath caught.

Crystal whispered into her hair,

"Whatever you choose, you're still ABIX."

Isabelle's eyes burned.

She held on.

Tighter than she expected.

Ivan cleared his throat.

"Group hug?" Crystal demanded, muffled.

Ivan sighed like he hated affection.

Then he stood.

He hugged them too.

Awkward.

Stiff.

But present.

Aleem stayed seated.

Not because he didn't care.

Because he knew this moment belonged to ABIX.

Isabelle pulled back.

Her cheeks were wet.

Crystal wiped her own face aggressively.

"Okay," she sniffed, "now I need to ask questions."

Isabelle laughed weakly.

"I knew it."

Crystal pointed.

"Can you still eat pork?"

Isabelle blinked.

"No," she admitted.

Crystal gasped like tragedy.

"WHAT ABOUT BACON?!"

Ivan muttered,

"Crystal, shut up."

Crystal snapped,

"I'M MOURNING."

Isabelle laughed through tears.

Then Crystal pointed again.

"Do you need to wear tudung?"

Isabelle shook her head.

"No," she said. "Not compulsory. If I choose, then it's my choice."

Crystal blinked.

"Oh," she muttered. "Okay. That's… actually nice."

Ivan's gaze shifted to Aleem.

He asked quietly,

"You didn't pressure?"

Aleem met his gaze.

"No," Aleem said. "I told her not to."

Ivan nodded.

Then he asked Isabelle,

"Are you doing okay with practice? Prayer? Stuff?"

Isabelle swallowed.

"Still learning," she admitted. "Slowly."

Ivan nodded again.

"Good," he said.

Crystal sniffed.

"I want to say… that Arabic word," she muttered. "The one you always say."

Aleem blinked.

"Which one?"

Crystal waved her hand.

"That one… Al… Alham… Alham--"

Isabelle laughed.

"Alhamdulillah," Isabelle corrected softly.

Crystal repeated, very seriously,

"Alham… doo… lilah."

Ivan sighed.

Close enough.

Crystal slapped her own cheeks lightly.

"Okay," she declared, "ALHAMDULILLAH."

Her pronunciation was questionable.

Her intention was pure.

Isabelle's throat tightened.

Aleem's lips twitched.

"Alhamdulillah," he echoed.

The room went quiet.

Not sad quiet.

A quiet that felt… sacred.

Because ABIX--

ABIX wasn't religious.

They weren't spiritual mentors.

They were just friends.

But friendship, when it was real, became its own kind of prayer.

A witness.

A holding.

A refusal to abandon.

Before they left, Isabelle said one more thing.

Her voice was soft.

"Please… don't tell anyone yet," she whispered. "My grandparents don't know. Extended family don't know. I need time."

Crystal nodded vigorously.

"Of course," she said. "We're not monsters."

Ivan nodded.

"Understood," he said.

Aleem's gaze softened.

"We go slow," he said.

Isabelle exhaled.

Slow.

Proper.

Still Belle.

Still ABIX.

As they walked out of her flat, Crystal turned back dramatically.

She pointed at Isabelle.

"By the way," she declared, "you are still my baby."

Isabelle laughed.

Ivan muttered,

"She's older than you."

Crystal snapped,

"SHUT UP."

And Isabelle--

Isabelle watched them go, heart full and aching at the same time.

Because the second reveal didn't break her.

It held her.

In the simplest way.

With snacks.

With tears.

With terrible Arabic pronunciation.

And with a love that didn't demand she stay the same to remain theirs.
