## Chapter 8 -- The Price of Being Seen

Brinevale did not know how to hold gratitude without turning it into a weapon.

By the time Mara woke the morning after Hollowmouth's rescue, the town had already remade the story into something that fit its hunger. In alleys, men spoke of how the mine had "nearly taken four," but "luck held." In the market, women murmured about "that girl from the tannery" who had "felt the stone shift," as if her senses were a strange animal instinct. At the rail yard, where gossip traveled as quickly as rope burns, the story sharpened further: Mara had "stopped a collapse with her hand," Mara had "talked the mine into staying still," Mara had "done guild work without a guild badge."

Some voices made it praise.

Some voices made it suspicion.

Brinevale's kindness was always conditional. It could lift you up for a moment and then demand payment.

Mara stepped into the street and felt eyes on her immediately.

Not the casual glances she was used to--people checking whether you were in their way--but deliberate looks, followed by whispers that stopped too quickly when she turned her head. A woman near the communal pump paused mid-draw and watched Mara with an expression that held both awe and fear. Two boys who had once called her "mule-girl" stared openly, uncertain whether mockery was still safe.

Mara kept walking.

She told herself she should be relieved. That being seen meant being respected.

But the attention sat on her skin like soot she couldn't wash off.

At the rail yard, Lorn was waiting.

He stood in the center of the planks with arms crossed, boots planted wide. His face was already red with anger, rain or no rain.

"You think you can just run off when you hear a bell?" he snapped the moment Mara approached.

Mara stopped a few steps away, hands at her sides.

"You abandoned your shift," Lorn continued, voice rising. "You left your load. You left your crew."

Mara's jaw tightened. "Three men were trapped," she said.

Lorn spat to the side, as if the ground deserved the insult. "And what, you're a healer now? You're a hero now?" He leaned forward slightly, eyes narrowing. "Or are you something else?"

The last words came with a different weight.

Not accusation of laziness.

Accusation of *difference.*

Men nearby paused their work, pretending they weren't listening.

Mara felt her palms itch with the instinct to anchor, to steady herself against the pressure of attention.

"I helped," she said carefully.

Lorn's smile was thin and ugly. "So it's true," he said. "You've got some… trick."

Mara said nothing.

Silence was safer than naming.

Lorn stepped closer. "If you've got a trick," he said, voice low now, "then you're worth more to me than hauling nails."

Mara's stomach clenched.

That was the danger.

In Brinevale, being useful was never a gift. It was a leash.

"What do you want?" she asked.

Lorn's eyes flicked around, checking who was near enough to hear. "The foreman told my cousin," he said. "Said you 'felt' the mine. Said you knew where supports needed to go."

Mara's throat tightened.

Lorn leaned in. "There's a merchant coming," he continued, voice low and hungry. "A wealthy one. He's got goods on his wagons that need careful handling. Fragile. Expensive. If something breaks, the yard pays."

Mara didn't respond.

Lorn smiled as if he could already see coin. "You're going to stand by the ramps," he said. "And you're going to make sure nothing slips. Nothing tips. Nothing breaks."

Mara's hands curled. "That's not--"

"You owe me," Lorn cut in sharply. "You owe this yard for leaving yesterday. You owe your crew."

Mara felt anger stir.

Not hot rage.

Cold indignation.

"You're using the rescue as leverage," she said.

Lorn shrugged. "Everything is leverage," he replied. "That's how the world works."

Mara stared at him.

She thought of Sable's words: *Power tempts you. Punish arrogance with imbalance.*

For a heartbeat, she imagined shifting Lorn's weight so he stumbled into the mud, humiliating him in front of everyone.

The temptation was sweet.

And easy.

Mara inhaled slowly.

Restraint.

"No," she said.

Lorn blinked.

His eyes hardened. "No?" he repeated, as if the word had no right to exist in his mouth.

Mara kept her voice steady. "I'm not your tool," she said.

Lorn's face flushed. "You think you're better than us now?" he hissed. "You think because you did one thing--"

"It wasn't one thing," Mara snapped, then immediately regretted the sharpness. Attention tightened around her.

Men paused. Someone coughed.

Lorn's voice grew louder. "If you've got guild tricks, the guild should know," he shouted.

Mara's stomach dropped.

The words rang with threat.

If Lorn reported her to the outpost, they would come.

Containment.

Registration.

Or worse.

Mara's breath tightened.

She anchored reflexively, sinking her weight into her feet.

She forced her voice calm. "I don't have guild tricks," she lied.

Lorn's eyes narrowed. He didn't believe her, but he enjoyed having power over her fear.

"Then do your job," he said, voice low again. "Or I'll find someone who will make sure the outpost hears about your little miracle."

Mara's chest felt tight.

She had saved lives.

And now the town was trying to sell her for it.

She worked the day under that pressure.

Wagons came and went. Men hauled crates. Lorn kept Mara stationed near the ramps like a guard dog, eyes watching her hands.

Mara did not use her craft openly.

Not because she refused to help--she still adjusted burdens subtly, smoothing load balances so carts rolled steadier, nudging stress away from cracked boards so they didn't snap.

But she did it small.

Invisible.

Because every time she did it, she felt the attention like a hook.

The merchant arrived in late afternoon.

His wagons were painted with bright sigils that looked almost obscene against Brinevale's soot. The horses were strong and well-fed. Two guards rode with him, armor clean.

The merchant himself wore a coat with fur trim, his fingers heavy with rings.

He stepped onto the planks and wrinkled his nose at the smell.

Lorn bowed slightly, all false humility. "Welcome to Brinevale yard," he said.

The merchant's eyes scanned the workers like they were part of inventory.

Then his gaze landed on Mara.

She felt it like a weight shift.

"That her?" the merchant asked.

Mara's stomach clenched.

Lorn smiled. "She's the one," he said.

The merchant approached, boots clean, stopping a few paces from Mara. He looked her up and down, assessing her like a tool.

"They say you can… keep loads steady," he said.

Mara's jaw tightened.

She said nothing.

The merchant smiled as if amused by her silence. "That's fine," he said. "I don't need you to talk. I need you to perform."

Mara's throat tightened.

He gestured toward one wagon. "Crates of glassware," he said. "Exotic. Delicate. If any break, I will make sure the cost is remembered."

Remembered.

In Brinevale, that meant punished.

The merchant leaned closer, lowering his voice. "And if you do well," he murmured, "perhaps I can recommend you to the guild. They like useful talents."

The word "useful" made Mara's skin crawl.

Before she could respond, a sudden shout came from the far end of the yard.

A cart had hit a slick patch and begun to slide.

It wasn't one of the merchant's wagons. It was a yard cart loaded with timber. The wheels skidded, and the timber stack leaned dangerously toward a cluster of workers.

Men shouted and scrambled.

Mara's heart slammed.

She saw it instantly: the cart's burden had shifted, the weight center moving too high, making the stack eager to topple.

If it fell, it would crush someone.

Mara moved without thinking.

She anchored.

She reached.

She shoved the weight center lower into the cart's base, making the timber's pull settle downward rather than sideways.

Warmth surged.

The cart's slide slowed.

The stack steadied.

But the debt had to go somewhere.

Mara felt the stress spike into the left wheel.

The wheel groaned.

She adjusted, spreading burden across both wheels, into the plank beneath.

The plank creaked.

Mara forced the debt into the ground, into deeper support beams.

The cart stopped.

Men stared.

Silence fell for half a heartbeat.

Then a rush of sound: shouting relief, laughter, curses.

Someone clapped another man on the back.

But the merchant was watching Mara with narrowed eyes.

He had seen.

And the way he looked at her was not admiration.

It was ownership.

He stepped forward slowly. "So it's true," he said.

Mara's breath came shallow.

The yard workers murmured. Some looked at her with awe. Some with fear.

Lorn's smile was smug.

The merchant's gaze drifted toward the guild outpost direction beyond town.

"I have business with the outpost," he said lightly. "They will want to know Brinevale harbors unregistered talent."

Mara's stomach dropped.

Lorn's face tightened, but he said nothing--because he had started this chain, and now it was beyond him.

Mara's palms itched.

Her craft could do something here.

She could shift the merchant's stance so he stumbled, breaking his composure.

She could tilt his weight so his rings caught on his coat, embarrassing him.

She could make his horse shy.

She could, with enough cruelty, cause real harm.

The temptation rose like a sweet dark taste.

Sable's warning echoed.

*The easiest path.*

Mara inhaled.

Negotiation.

She looked at the merchant calmly. "If you tell the outpost," she said, voice steady, "they'll take you too."

The merchant blinked.

Mara continued, carefully. "Because you're transporting glassware," she said. "Delicate goods. They'll inspect. They'll demand fees. They'll ask for documentation. They'll keep you waiting."

The merchant's eyes narrowed, suspicious.

Mara added, "And if any crate breaks while you're delayed, your loss will be yours. Not Brinevale's."

The merchant's mouth tightened. He didn't like being reminded he wasn't immune to consequences.

Mara held his gaze. "You want your goods moved safely," she said. "Let me do my job. Then leave."

The merchant studied her.

Mara felt the weight of his decision settling, the way a stone chose where to rest.

Finally, he smiled--thin, calculated. "Very well," he said. "For now."

He turned away as if the matter was settled.

But Mara saw it in his posture.

He would not forget.

People like him never forgot opportunities.

As the merchant's wagons were unloaded, Mara worked with meticulous restraint. She adjusted weight centers subtly so crates stayed steady. She distributed stress along ramps so no plank took too much burden. She anchored herself constantly, sinking backlash into the ground.

By dusk, the merchant was satisfied.

He mounted his horse, glanced at Mara once, and said softly, "We'll speak again."

Then he left.

The yard returned to its usual noise, but something had shifted.

Workers looked at Mara differently.

Some with respect.

Some with resentment.

Some with a hungry curiosity that made Mara's skin crawl.

As she walked home, she felt Brinevale's eyes on her like hooks.

In the alley near the tannery, two women whispered as she passed.

"She's blessed," one said.

"She's cursed," the other replied.

Mara climbed to her room and shut the door.

For a moment, she leaned against it, breathing.

Her hands trembled.

Not from exhaustion.

From the realization that saving lives had put her on a path she couldn't step off.

The world had seen her.

And now it would demand payment.

A soft knock came.

Mara stiffened.

Another knock.

Then a voice, low. "It's me," Pell whispered.

Mara opened the door a crack.

Pell stood in the hallway, eyes wide, face pale.

"They're saying the outpost heard," he whispered. "They're saying a guild inspector is coming tomorrow."

Mara's stomach dropped.

The guild.

After the table incident, after Hollowmouth, after the merchant.

They were coming.

Mara's throat tightened. "Who told you?"

Pell swallowed. "My aunt works near the outpost," he said. "She heard clerks talking. They said an irregular manifested in Brinevale. They said…" His voice shook. "They said the guild doesn't like irregulars."

Mara's hands clenched.

Sable had warned her.

The guild would either cage or destroy.

Mara closed her eyes briefly, forcing breath.

Anchor.

Sink the panic.

She opened her eyes again.

"Thank you," she said to Pell.

Pell's gaze searched her face. "What are you going to do?" he asked.

Mara looked out the small window at Brinevale's smoky night, forge glow pulsing like embers.

She thought of Sable in the hills.

Of bedrock certainty.

Of discipline.

"I'm going to meet my teacher," she said.

Pell blinked. "Teacher?"

Mara nodded. "Go home," she said gently. "And don't tell anyone you came here."

Pell hesitated, then nodded and hurried away.

Mara sat on her thin mattress and stared at her hands.

She had wanted recognition.

She had wanted someone to understand that her craft mattered.

Now understanding was coming.

But not in the way she had imagined.

Outside, Brinevale kept breathing smoke into the sky.

Inside, Mara anchored herself against fear.

Because tomorrow, the guild's gaze would arrive.

And she would have to decide whether to remain a tool in their ledger…

Or become the kind of weight they couldn't move.
