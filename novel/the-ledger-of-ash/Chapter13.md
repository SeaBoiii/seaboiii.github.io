## Chapter 13 -- Clean Shaping

The cave felt different after the pass.

Not because the stone walls had moved or the lantern burned any brighter, but because Mara had seen her craft used as a trap in someone else's hands. The diagrams on the walls no longer looked like quiet study. They looked like weapons manuals written in charcoal. Every spiral carried the possibility of a scar. Every arrow could become a shove the world remembered.

Mara lay awake long after Sable's breathing steadied into sleep.

She listened to the cave's pull field, trying to feel whether her small interventions earlier had left residue. She imagined thumbprints in the air, faint dents in downness that a siphon-stone could catch like a hook.

The thought made her stomach tighten.

When she finally slept, she dreamed again.

Not of falling.

This time she dreamed of fingerprints.

She walked through a field of snow and saw her own tracks behind her, deep and obvious. She tried to step lighter, but the snow still marked her. She tried to walk backward, but the snow still held her shape. Then she looked up and saw a stranger collecting her footprints in a sack.

She woke with her heart pounding.

Sable was already awake, lantern lit.

He looked at her once and seemed to know enough.

"Good," he said.

Mara blinked, confused.

Sable's voice was calm. "Fear makes you honest," he continued. "And honesty is the beginning of clean shaping."

Mara swallowed.

Sable motioned for her to sit at the stone slab.

He placed three items in front of her.

A pebble.

A shallow bowl of water.

A flat disk of slate etched with a faint spiral.

Mara stared.

The spiral looked similar to the siphon-stone's carving, but rougher, less polished.

"What is that?" Mara asked.

Sable's gaze stayed on the disk. "A mirror," he said.

Mara frowned. "It doesn't reflect," she said.

Sable nodded. "Not light," he replied. "Pull."

He lifted the disk and pressed it lightly against the slab.

Mara's senses flared.

She felt the pull field around it shift--not because the disk altered pull, but because it *revealed* the field's current shape, making its lines easier to sense. It was like pressing your ear to a wall to hear a conversation more clearly.

Mara's breath caught.

Sable looked at her. "Clean shaping begins with noticing what the world already is," he said. "Most people shape by forcing an idea onto the field. That leaves a scar."

Mara swallowed. "So… I need to shape by… listening?"

Sable nodded. "Yes," he said. "And by letting the world do the work of returning."

He placed the mirror-disk back on the slab.

"Rule four taught you residue exists," he said. "Now you learn how to avoid feeding it."

Mara's chest tightened.

Sable gestured toward the bowl of water. "You'll practice on water," he said.

Mara blinked. "Why water?"

Sable's mouth curved faintly. "Because water is forgiving," he replied. "Stone remembers. Water forgets faster."

Mara stared at the bowl.

The water's surface was still, reflecting lantern flame.

Sable placed the pebble beside the bowl. "Make the pebble roll into the bowl," he instructed.

Mara frowned. She could do that easily with burden shifting.

Sable's gaze sharpened. "No burden shift," he said. "Pull shaping only. And when you're done, the pull field must return to what it was. No lingering thumbprints."

Mara's throat tightened.

She anchored.

Then she reached for the pull line between pebble and slab.

Resistance.

A faint nausea stirred.

She tilted downness slightly toward the bowl.

The pebble rolled.

It bumped the bowl's rim.

It stopped.

Mara frowned.

Sable's voice was calm. "You pushed," he said.

Mara's jaw tightened. "I only--"

Sable cut her off gently. "You imposed," he said. "Now the field is holding your imprint. That's why the pebble stopped at the rim. The pull line isn't smooth."

Mara's stomach dropped.

She reached again, sensing the area.

She felt it now: a faint twist in the pull field where she had tilted. Like a crease.

Residue.

Mara's throat tightened. "How do I… remove it?" she asked.

Sable's eyes stayed steady. "You don't remove," he said. "You **restore**."

He pointed to the mirror-disk. "Use it," he said.

Mara pressed her palm lightly near the spiral disk.

Her senses sharpened.

She could feel the field's lines more clearly--where downness flowed smoothly, where it kinked.

Mara breathed.

Anchor.

Then she softened her own imprint, not by forcing it away, but by tilting the field back toward its natural shape in tiny increments.

Like smoothing a wrinkled cloth.

The nausea eased as the field relaxed.

The crease faded.

Mara exhaled.

Sable nodded once. "Again," he said.

Mara tried again, but this time she did something different.

Instead of tilting downness directly toward the bowl, she sensed the natural pull line and asked where it *wanted* to go. The slab had a slight unevenness. The bowl's weight pressed into stone. Those factors already biased the field subtly.

Mara found that bias.

She leaned into it.

A breath's worth.

The pebble rolled.

This time it didn't stop at the rim.

It slipped into the bowl and dropped into water with a small plunk.

The water rippled.

Mara released her shaping gently.

She felt the field relax back.

No sharp crease.

No lingering thumbprint.

Sable's eyes held quiet approval. "Better," he said.

Mara swallowed, heat rising in her chest.

She had shaped and restored.

It felt like closing a door behind her rather than leaving it ajar.

Sable continued the lesson with maddening patience.

He made her roll the pebble into the bowl from different angles.

He made her stop the pebble just before it fell, then let it drop without leaving residue.

He made her tilt the water's surface into a gentle slant and then return it to stillness.

Each time, if she left even a faint crease in the field, he made her sense it, name it, and smooth it.

Hours passed.

Mara's stomach fluttered repeatedly with minor nausea, but she learned to anchor through it. She learned to use the environment's natural biases rather than impose her will.

She began to feel the difference between an argument and a suggestion.

In the afternoon, Sable introduced the second part of clean shaping.

He placed a thin rod of metal on the slab, balanced on a small stone like a lever.

"Make it tip," he said.

Mara anchored and reached.

She tilted pull slightly.

The rod tipped.

Sable raised a hand. "Stop," he said.

Mara froze.

Sable pointed at the lever's contact point. "Feel the residue," he said.

Mara closed her eyes and sensed.

A faint dent in the pull field clung to the contact point.

Mara swallowed.

Sable's voice was low. "You shaped the field," he said. "But you left the residue concentrated at a single point. That's how siphon-stones bite. They catch concentrated scars."

Mara's throat tightened.

Sable continued, "Clean shaping isn't only about restoring," he said. "It's about **spreading**."

Mara frowned. "Spreading residue?"

Sable nodded. "If you must leave a trace, make it too thin to harvest," he said.

Mara's skin prickled.

Sable gestured to the rod again. "Try again," he said. "Tip it, but distribute the field adjustment across a wider area."

Mara anchored.

She sensed the lever system--rod, stone fulcrum, slab.

Instead of tilting a small spot under the rod, she shaped the pull field in a broader gentle gradient, like a slope that extended beyond the object.

The rod tipped.

When she released, the residue was not a dent.

It was a faint softness spread over a wide area.

Harder to detect.

Harder to harvest.

Sable nodded. "That's the craft," he said. "Sometimes you cannot leave nothing. But you can leave **noise** instead of a hook."

Mara swallowed.

She thought of the gorge river scar--deep and concentrated.

That was a hook.

Her interventions in the pass, softened, had been less of a hook.

Now she understood why.

She had been spreading without knowing.

Sable watched her expression shift and spoke softly. "You did well today," he said.

Mara exhaled shakily. "I'm scared," she admitted.

Sable nodded. "Good," he said again. "Fear keeps you from becoming careless."

Mara looked down at her hands.

They were still callused.

Still stained.

But now they had done something subtle and difficult.

They had touched the world without leaving fingerprints.

That evening, as wind sighed outside the cave and lantern light trembled against stone, Sable told her something he hadn't said before.

He sat with his back to the wall, gaze distant.

"The guild doesn't train clean shaping," he said.

Mara's head snapped up. "Why not?"

Sable's mouth tightened. "Because clean shaping is harder to monitor," he said. "They prefer techniques that leave clear traces, because traces can be audited. They like power that can be counted."

Mara's stomach tightened.

Sable continued, "They teach weightwrights to shape in official ways--heavy, visible, predictable. Then they write rules around those techniques. They build cages from predictability."

Mara swallowed.

"And siphon-stones?" she asked.

Sable's eyes sharpened. "The guild pretends they don't exist," he said. "Because admitting residue can be harvested would mean admitting their own training creates currency for criminals."

Mara's throat tightened.

It was uglier than she had imagined.

Not just fear.

Bureaucracy.

Convenience.

Control.

Mara stared at the chalk diagrams.

The world was a ledger.

And everyone wanted to write her name on their terms.

Sable leaned forward slightly. "But you," he said, "will learn what they refuse to teach."

Mara's chest tightened.

A strange resolve rose.

Not pride.

Not anger.

Something steadier.

"I'll learn," she said.

Sable nodded. "Good," he replied.

Mara lay down that night with the sensation of pull lines still humming in her bones.

But when she drifted into sleep, her dreams changed.

She still saw snow.

She still saw footprints.

But now, when she stepped, the snow barely marked her.

And behind her, the stranger collecting prints found nothing to gather.

### Skill Notes (Clean Shaping fundamentals)

**Clean Shaping:** Pull shaping with deliberate restoration and/or diffusion to minimize harvestable residue.

1. **Restore:** After shaping, smooth the pull field back toward its natural equilibrium (avoid leaving "creases").
2. **Diffuse:** If a trace must remain, distribute it as low-intensity noise across a broader area to prevent siphon-stone "hooks."

**Tool -- Mirror Disk:** A carved slate that amplifies the *sensed* pull field shape, helping identify residue and gradients.
