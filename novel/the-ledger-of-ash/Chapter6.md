## Chapter 6 -- Negotiation, Not Wrestling

Training did not feel like the stories.

Mara had grown up on scraps of tavern tales and traveling bard songs where power arrived as revelation: a burst of light, a voice in the sky, a blade pulled from stone. In those stories, the chosen ones woke one morning and discovered they were different, and the world made room for them whether it wanted to or not.

Sable made no room for Mara.

He did not praise her for small successes. He did not soften exercises because she looked tired. He did not offer dramatic secrets wrapped in poetry.

He simply returned her to the same truths again and again until they began to live in her bones.

Mara met him before dawn for four days straight. Each morning, Brinevale still slept under smoke and damp, and each morning Mara walked beyond the town's edge with her pack and her stubborn heart. The hills greeted her with cold grass and mist, and the river greeted her with its endless churn.

The basin Sable chose for training lay farther from town than Mara would have ventured alone: a hollow between two ridges where the ground was littered with stones as if some ancient giant had spilled a sack. Old mine openings dotted the slopes, dark mouths half-collapsed and half-swallowed by weeds. The air there tasted of wet rock and pine sap, clean enough that Mara could almost forget the tannery's stink.

Almost.

On the first morning, Sable made her stand barefoot on a flat slab of stone.

The stone was cold enough to hurt.

Mara shifted her weight instinctively, trying to find a warmer patch.

Sable's voice came calm and relentless. "Don't move," he said.

Mara's jaw tightened. "My feet--"

"Feel them," Sable interrupted.

Mara swallowed her complaint and stood.

Cold seeped into her soles. Her toes curled. Her calves tensed.

Sable circled her, hands behind his back. "Your body is always negotiating with weight," he said. "When you tense, you push weight into joints. When you fear, you lift your shoulders and burden your neck. When you are ashamed, you collapse your chest and send weight into your spine."

Mara's face flushed. "I'm not ashamed," she muttered.

Sable's gaze was sharp. "You are," he said simply.

The bluntness stung more than cold.

Mara wanted to argue.

But when she checked her body honestly, she realized her chest *was* collapsed, shoulders drawn slightly inward, as if making herself smaller could protect her.

Sable stepped closer. "Open," he said.

Mara hesitated.

Sable didn't repeat himself.

Slowly, Mara rolled her shoulders back. She lifted her sternum just a fraction. She loosened her jaw.

Her breath deepened.

And in that small adjustment, she felt something shift--not in the world, but in her.

Her weight settled.

Less scattered.

More honest.

"Better," Sable said, as if he had been waiting for her to stop lying with her posture.

He made her stand like that until the cold stopped feeling like punishment and became information. Until she could feel the difference between tension and grounding, between bracing and anchoring.

When he finally allowed her to step off the stone, her feet were numb and her legs shook.

"That was pointless," Mara said through clenched teeth.

Sable's eyes narrowed slightly. "Was it?" he asked.

Mara opened her mouth to retort.

Then she realized something.

Her head did not hurt.

The ache behind her eyes that usually arrived after practicing weight shifts was absent. Even though she had used her craft the previous day. Even though she was tired.

Her body felt… quieter.

Sable watched understanding dawn and gave no smile. "You can't pour backlash into a body already full of tension," he said. "The overflow goes into your mind. Then you call it headache and think you are weak. You are not weak. You are unprepared."

Mara swallowed.

Unprepared.

It was a kinder word than worthless.

And more useful.

On the second morning, Sable introduced stones.

Not her familiar small stones, but heavier rocks the size of bread loaves.

He arranged them in a line and told Mara to move their weight without moving their bodies.

Mara crouched beside the first rock, breathed, and shifted its burden to one edge. The rock tipped slightly, its weight leaning as if it wanted to roll.

Backlash pricked behind her eyes.

Sable's voice cut in immediately. "Anchor," he said.

Mara tried again, focusing first on sinking her own weight into her heels, borrowing certainty from bedrock.

She shifted the rock's burden.

The warmth tingled in her palm, the familiar internal tug.

This time, when backlash stirred, she guided it downward.

Her heels tingled.

Her head remained clear.

Mara blinked.

Sable nodded once. "Good," he said. "Now do it again. And again. Until you can do it without thinking."

Hours passed like that.

Sable was merciless with repetition.

Mara's muscles burned. Her knees ached from crouching. Her palms tingled with that strange warmth that came when she touched weight.

But as she repeated, something in her began to change.

The act of anchoring stopped feeling like a deliberate step. It began to feel like breathing.

Her body learned where stability lived.

And her mind learned to stop flailing.

On the third morning, Sable made her walk.

He took her up the ridge where the ground sloped sharply and the grass grew sparse, replaced by loose stones. Mist clung to the hillside, and wind tugged at their clothes.

Sable walked ahead without hurry, stepping over rocks as if each footfall had been measured.

Mara followed, struggling to keep balance.

At one point her boot slipped on a wet stone and she windmilled her arms.

Sable stopped without turning. "Don't fight," he said.

Mara caught herself, heart racing. "What do you mean?"

Sable turned then, eyes calm. "You keep trying to hold yourself upright by force," he said. "You clench. You yank. You wrestle your own balance."

Mara swallowed. "If I don't, I'll fall."

Sable's gaze sharpened. "Falling is not failure," he said. "Refusing to learn is."

He stepped onto a slick stone deliberately, then shifted his weight in a subtle way. His foot didn't slip.

He looked at Mara. "Anchor," he said.

Mara tried.

She sank her weight into her stance, imagining it settling into the stone like sand. Her boot's grip improved.

But the slope still pulled at her.

Sable watched her struggle and spoke again. "Now shift the world's pull, just slightly," he said.

Mara froze.

She had touched the gravity thread once beyond town, and the backlash had been sharp. She hadn't dared do it again.

Sable's voice remained steady. "Don't be dramatic," he said. "A breath's worth. Not a storm."

Mara's throat tightened.

She anchored harder, borrowing bedrock certainty.

Then she reached--not into her own body, but into the relationship between her and the slope.

She imagined the pull line beneath her feet tilting a fraction, making the slope feel less eager to drag her down.

Warmth surged.

A sharper backlash tried to bite her temples.

Mara guided it downward as Sable had taught.

Her heels tingled almost painfully.

For a heartbeat, the slope's insistence softened.

Mara's posture steadied.

She blinked, breath shaky.

Sable nodded. "There," he said. "You didn't conquer the hill. You negotiated with it."

Mara exhaled slowly.

Negotiation.

The word fit.

On the fourth morning, Sable finally named what Mara was doing.

They stood in the basin with stones arranged in a circle. Mist had thinned into a low veil, and sunlight filtered through, pale and cold.

Sable watched Mara shift weight in a stone with calm precision, then watched her shift it back, then watched her spread the debt across two other stones so no single point took all the burden.

When she finished, he spoke.

"Your craft is called **weightwrighting**," he said.

The word landed with a solidity Mara felt in her chest.

Weightwright.

Not utility.

Not mule.

A maker.

A builder.

Sable continued, voice low. "Wrights build bridges, wheels, beams," he said. "You build balance."

Mara swallowed. The title felt too big for her callused hands.

Sable stepped toward the circle of stones. "Now," he said, "you will learn why the guild fears your craft."

Mara's skin prickled.

Sable picked up a stone and placed it atop another, forming a simple stack.

"Shift weight into the top stone's edge," he instructed.

Mara did.

The top stone leaned.

The stack trembled.

Sable held up a hand. "Stop," he said before it fell. "You see? A small shift can destabilize an entire structure."

Mara's throat tightened.

Sable's eyes stayed on the stones. "Fire burns what it touches," he said. "Lightning strikes and leaves a visible scar. People fear those because they can see the danger."

He looked up at Mara.

"Weight is invisible," he continued. "A weightwright can make a bridge collapse without touching it. A weightwright can make a wall fail during a storm. A weightwright can make a crowd stumble by stealing balance. And no one will know why until it's too late."

Mara's stomach turned.

She remembered standing on the bridge, imagining shifting its burden into a fracture.

The thought had frightened her.

Sable's voice remained calm, but his words carried weight like a hammer's head. "That is why you need discipline," he said. "Not because you are dangerous by nature. But because your craft makes you responsible for consequences most people never consider."

Mara's hands curled into fists. "I don't want to hurt anyone," she said.

Sable nodded. "Then you must learn the difference between control and restraint."

He stepped away from the stones and gestured toward a fallen branch nearby.

"Pick it up," he said.

Mara picked it up. It was wet and heavier than it looked.

Sable pointed to a narrow gap between two rocks. "Drop it there," he instructed.

Mara did.

The branch landed awkwardly, half supported by stone, half hanging over a small hollow.

Sable stepped back. "Now," he said, "make it stable without moving it."

Mara stared.

The branch's weight distribution made it want to tip.

She reached for its burden, felt how heaviness collected toward the hanging end.

She could shift that burden inward, toward the supported end.

But the debt would go somewhere.

If she made one end lighter, the other would become heavier.

She needed to choose where the branch could safely bear more weight.

Mara inhaled slowly.

She anchored, sinking her own weight into bedrock certainty.

Then she shifted the branch's burden toward the supported end--small, precise.

The branch settled more firmly against the rocks.

But the supported stone pressed deeper into mud.

Mara felt it, the debt collecting.

She adjusted again, spreading the debt between both supporting rocks, letting some burden settle into the ground itself rather than one point.

The branch held.

The rocks held.

Mara exhaled.

Sable nodded. "That," he said, "is the craft. You didn't make the branch weightless. You made the system honest."

Mara's throat tightened with a strange emotion.

Honest.

Brinevale was built on dishonesty--patching, pretending, hoping the debt wouldn't come due today.

Her craft could make honesty unavoidable.

Sable studied her quietly. "You keep thinking mastery is the ability to move more weight," he said.

Mara frowned. "Isn't it?"

Sable shook his head. "Mastery is knowing when not to move it," he replied. "Knowing when to let the world settle naturally, and when to intervene."

Mara stared at the branch.

Her mind flashed to the rail yard. If she had spoken up about the wagon's uneven load, perhaps the accident could have been prevented without her shifting anything.

But she hadn't spoken because she'd assumed no one would listen.

Sable's gaze stayed steady. "Your voice is also part of your craft," he said, as if reading her thought.

Mara's jaw tightened. "No one listens," she muttered.

Sable's voice softened slightly. "They will," he said. "When the world starts behaving differently around you."

Mara swallowed.

They trained until her arms trembled and her legs felt heavy, until she could anchor without thinking, until she could shift weight with smaller and smaller movements, making her craft less visible and more precise.

At the end of the day, as the sun began to sink behind the ridge and mist thickened again, Sable walked with her toward the town path.

Brinevale's smoke smear was visible in the valley, a dark stain on the horizon.

Mara's body ached in new ways--not the ache of labor, but the ache of learning.

Sable stopped at the edge of the ridge. "Tomorrow," he said.

Mara nodded, too tired to speak.

Sable's gaze held hers. "And Mara," he added.

"Yes?"

"Your craft will tempt you," Sable said quietly. "You will feel how easy it is to make things fail. You will feel how satisfying it is to punish arrogance with imbalance."

Mara's stomach tightened.

Sable continued, voice calm and sharp. "If you indulge that satisfaction, you will become what the guild fears. Not because your gift is evil, but because power without restraint always chooses the easiest path."

Mara swallowed.

She thought of Rellan.

Of laughter.

Of dismissal.

Anger stirred.

But beneath anger was something harder.

Resolve.

"I'll learn restraint," Mara said.

Sable studied her for a long moment.

Then he nodded once. "Good," he said.

Mara began walking down toward Brinevale.

As she descended, the hill's pull tugged at her, but she no longer fought it. She anchored when needed, shifted the world's insistence a breath's worth when the ground grew too slick.

Each step was a negotiation.

Not wrestling.

And when she reached the town's edge and the smoke taste returned to her mouth like an old curse, Mara realized something with quiet certainty.

The guild could laugh.

Brinevale could dismiss.

But the world's quiet laws had begun to recognize her.

And she was learning how to recognize them back.

### Skill Notes (as Mara understands them now)

**Technique -- Anchor:** Concentrate your own weight into stable points (heels, stance) to resist slipping and backlash.

**Principle -- Debt Placement:** Any weight shifted away must settle somewhere; mastery is choosing where it can safely live.

**Practice -- Negotiation:** Small, precise shifts guided by breath and posture outperform forceful "shoves," reducing backlash and collateral stress.
