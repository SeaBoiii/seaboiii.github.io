**Chapter 6: Something to Hold**

The week after their quiet dinner passed like a soft breeze—there, then gone.

They didn’t talk about that night. Not directly. Not in words that would pin anything down. Instead, they moved gently around each other, like dancers aware of the edge of a stage.

There was a closeness that lingered in glances, in the way their conversations slowed instead of ending. But there was also a quiet uncertainty—an unspoken distance that began to creep in, not because they were pulling apart, but because neither knew how to step forward.

Meilin noticed it in the way Rafiq paused more often before replying to her texts, as though weighing his words. She noticed it in herself too—the way she started reading into his silences, not suspiciously, but cautiously. She was afraid of assuming too much. Afraid of mistaking kindness for invitation.

Rafiq, on his end, wrestled with the desire to be transparent and the fear of being premature. He wanted to ask if she’d been thinking about that night too. But he didn’t. Because naming something too soon had a way of scaring it away.

Still, the closeness remained. Not loud. Not obvious. But undeniably present.

A shared quiet. The kind that spoke more clearly than questions ever could.

And yet, with every new moment of closeness, came a shadow of restraint.

Meilin found herself thinking twice before sending a message. Typing, deleting, then typing again. She didn’t want to overstep. She didn’t want to make fragile things crack.

Rafiq, too, hesitated. Not because he doubted her, but because he feared his own hope.

So he waited.

And then, on a rainy Thursday afternoon, Meilin returned from a meeting to find a small, carefully wrapped package resting on her desk.

No card. No name. Just her name written on the front in familiar, angled handwriting.

She sat down slowly, the rain tapping lightly against the window beside her. Her fingers brushed the paper, then unfolded it.

Inside was a navy blue notebook.

Unlined. Simple. With a small, gold-embossed star on the corner.

She opened the cover. Just beneath the flap, in neat, careful handwriting:

*In case you ever need a place to be heard.*

Meilin didn’t move for a long while.

The pages were filled sparsely, delicately. Song fragments. Unsent thoughts. Observations that felt like echoes of conversations they’d had—and ones they hadn’t yet.

One page read: *Your voice makes silence feel like a blessing.*

Another: *I think about the way you speak when you’re tired. Like the truth comes through softer, but stronger.*

Her hands trembled just slightly. Not from overwhelm, but from knowing.

She closed the notebook. Then opened it again.

She ran her fingers along the spine, letting its weight rest in her lap. Her mind was too full to settle, her heart a quiet ache. Not painful. Just tender.

What kind of person shares the raw, unpolished pieces of himself without expecting anything in return? Who offers space without asking to be let in?

It felt like standing in someone’s room and being allowed to stay. No performance. No pretense.

She turned another page. Then another.

Some of the entries were just lines. Half-finished thoughts. A scribbled phrase about stars. A mention of a moment they had shared—a coffee she had brought him, a line from a song she hummed under her breath. Things she hadn’t even realized he had noticed.

Her chest tightened. Not in fear. But in a kind of reverent awe.

This wasn’t a love letter. Not exactly.

But it was a kind of offering. A window left open. A chair pulled out at the table.

A place where someone had offered space—not to impress, but to share.

And now that it was hers, she didn’t want to fill it.

She wanted to carry it. Carefully. Quietly. Like it meant something.

Because it did.

**Rafiq**

That night, Rafiq sat on his bed, back against the wall, the soft hum of rain outside barely audible over the noise in his head. He stared at the ceiling, notebook resting on his lap, wondering if he had gone too far.

Was it too personal? Too vulnerable?

He hadn’t told anyone else about the journal—not even his closest friends. It wasn’t a confession. It wasn’t even meant to ask for anything. It was just… a way of placing his feelings somewhere safe. And somehow, she had become that place.

He kept imagining her opening the package. What expression she might’ve worn. Whether she would recognize the careful way he had selected each word.

And he realized, with a quiet, aching clarity, that this was the first time in years he had given someone a part of himself without a guard up.

He hadn’t expected a reply. And none came—not that afternoon, not that evening.

He kept checking his phone, pretending he wasn’t.

Then, just after ten, his screen lit up.

**Meilin:** *Page 27 is my favorite.*

His heart stilled. He reached for the notebook beside his pillow and flipped quickly.

Page 27. One sentence:

*I didn’t know I was waiting until you walked in and stayed.*

He closed the book, smiling quietly to himself.

And in that moment, he no longer needed to be heard.

He just needed her to know he had been listening all along.

**Meilin**

She stared at the message bubble after typing it, fingers hovering above the screen. It wasn’t the most articulate thing she could have said. It wasn’t even what she had meant to say.

But it was what felt honest.

She had thought about writing more—telling him how the notebook made her feel seen in a way she hadn’t known she’d missed. How reading his words felt like tracing the outline of a constellation that somehow included her. But everything she tried to type felt too heavy or too fragile.

So instead, she picked that line. That one sentence he probably didn’t even remember writing.

Because it told her everything she needed to know.

And she hoped, in some quiet way, it told him the same.
