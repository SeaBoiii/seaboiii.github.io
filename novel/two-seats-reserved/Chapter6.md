At five o'clock, Penang looked harmless.

The sun was still bright but less cruel than midday, the sky washed into a pale blue haze that made the island feel as if it were under a thin sheet. Traffic moved with that familiar impatience of a city that had places to be and no patience for hesitation. Motorbikes slipped between cars like they were made of water. The air smelled faintly of hot asphalt and salt, the sea somewhere nearby even if you couldn't see it.

And somewhere between the harmlessness of a normal weekday and the weight of an old message, Jiawen's phone sat on the dining table like a small ticking thing.

Faris didn't look at it.

He didn't want to give it the dignity of attention.

But his mind had already memorised the words.

*Tomorrow. Queensbay Mall. 5pm. Last chance. If you don't come, I talk to your parents properly.*

The threatening part wasn't the location.

The threatening part was the way Junhao believed he still had the right to say *properly.*

Like he could claim the language Faris and Jiawen had worked so hard to build.

The morning had started with careful quiet.

Jiawen's father had woken early and gone to the market with Jiawen's mother. Faris had offered to go too, but Jiawen's mother had waved him off--*you sleep, later tired*--and Jiawen's father had given him a look that felt like a quiet assessment: not *I don't want you*, but *later we talk.*

Jiawen had hovered in the living room with her laptop open, pretending she was answering work messages, though Faris could tell she was using the screen as a shield. Her fingers moved, but her eyes weren't fully on the words.

Faris made coffee and waited.

At some point, Jiawen finally spoke without looking up.

"Okay," she said softly. "We tell my father."

Faris nodded.

Not because he needed her permission.

Because this was her family.

Her lane.

Door deal.

Jiawen's parents returned close to noon carrying plastic bags that smelled like vegetables and wet fish and market air. Jiawen's mother moved straight to the kitchen and started unpacking with brisk efficiency.

Her father washed his hands, then sat at the dining table with a cup of coffee.

He looked at Jiawen.

Jiawen looked back.

For a second, the air tightened.

Then Jiawen walked over, phone in her hand, and placed it on the table.

"Pa," she said quietly.

Her father's gaze dropped to the phone.

"What?" he asked.

Jiawen's throat moved.

Faris stayed a few steps behind, leaning lightly against the door frame--present, but not encroaching.

Jiawen unlocked the phone and opened the message.

She didn't shove it.

She didn't dramatise it.

She simply turned the screen toward her father.

The words were there.

Queensbay Mall.

Five p.m.

*Last chance.*

Her father's face changed.

Not shock.

Not confusion.

Something colder.

A controlled fury that didn't need volume.

He read it twice.

Then he looked up.

"Junhao," he said.

Jiawen nodded.

Her father's jaw tightened. "He is in Penang?"

"I don't know," Jiawen replied. "But he's acting like he is."

Her father's eyes narrowed slightly. "He talk to Mei Li already."

Jiawen nodded again.

Her father sat back, exhaled through his nose.

Then he said, calmly, "You won't go."

Jiawen's shoulders loosened a fraction.

"I won't," she said.

Her father stared at the message again.

Then he looked at Faris.

Faris met his gaze.

"You," her father said.

Faris straightened slightly. "Yes, Uncle."

Her father's voice stayed level. "What you think?"

Faris chose his words carefully.

"I think he wants a reaction," Faris said. "He wants to make it a scene. We don't give him that."

Her father nodded slowly.

Faris continued, calm and practical. "We screenshot. We keep record. If he shows up near the house or tries to approach Jiawen, we call authorities. No meeting. No conversation."

Jiawen's father's eyes stayed on Faris for a long moment.

Then, unexpectedly, he asked, "You scared?"

Faris blinked.

It wasn't the question he expected.

He answered honestly.

"I'm angry," he said. "But I'm not scared."

Her father's mouth twitched faintly.

"Good," he said.

Then he turned back to Jiawen.

"You," he said to her, voice softer but firm, "you don't reply. You don't go. You don't let him talk."

Jiawen nodded.

Her father stood.

He walked into the kitchen, where Jiawen's mother was chopping vegetables, and spoke to her in a low voice.

Faris couldn't hear every word, but he caught Junhao's name.

He saw Jiawen's mother's posture stiffen.

Then, after a moment, she turned and walked back into the living room, wiping her hands on a towel.

"What happened?" she asked Jiawen.

Jiawen swallowed and showed her the message.

Her mother read it once.

Then her face tightened.

"Why he so shameless?" she muttered.

Jiawen's mouth trembled. "Ma--"

Her mother waved a hand sharply. "No. You already break up. He cheat. Why he still disturb?"

The bluntness of the words made Jiawen flinch.

Faris watched Jiawen's eyes glisten.

Her mother softened immediately, stepping closer.

"Aiya," she said, voice gentler now. "Don't cry. Not worth."

Jiawen blinked hard. "I'm not crying."

Her mother looked at Faris.

"Faris," she said, voice careful, "you don't do stupid thing, okay?"

Faris blinked. "Auntie?"

Her mother's eyes narrowed. "Men always want to be hero. No need hero. You just… be calm."

Faris felt his ears warm.

Jiawen let out a breathy laugh despite herself.

"I told you," Jiawen murmured. "Handsome HR."

Faris shot her a look.

Jiawen smiled faintly, then turned to her parents.

"I will handle properly," she said, voice steady. "No meeting. No reply. But… I want to do something more."

Her father's brows lifted slightly. "What?"

Jiawen's eyes sharpened.

"I want to file a report," she said.

The air went still.

Her mother blinked. "Police?"

Jiawen nodded. "At least a report. So if he escalates, there's a record."

Her father stared at her.

Then he nodded slowly.

"Good," he said.

Jiawen's shoulders lowered, relief moving through her like a wave.

Faris watched her.

In that moment, he felt something in his chest loosen.

This was what he'd wanted for her.

Not to be saved.

To be supported.

To choose her own closure.

***

They didn't go to Queensbay Mall.

Not at five.

Not at any time.

Instead, they went to the police station at four.

It was a small building that smelled faintly of disinfectant and old paper. A ceiling fan spun lazily overhead, stirring the warm air. The fluorescent lights were softer than office lights, but still carried that institutional glare.

Faris sat beside Jiawen in the waiting area, knees apart slightly, hands clasped loosely.

Jiawen sat upright, phone in her hand, screenshots already prepared. Her posture was calm, but Faris could see the tension in her jaw.

Jiawen's father sat on her other side, arms crossed.

He looked like a man who had decided to stay calm until he wasn't.

Jiawen's mother had insisted on coming too.

"I want to see," she'd said, grabbing her bag like this was another errand.

Now she sat slightly behind them, fanning herself with a tissue packet and glaring at nothing in particular.

A police officer called Jiawen's name.

Jiawen stood.

Faris stood too.

Jiawen's father stood.

The officer blinked at the small entourage.

"This way," he said.

They entered a small room.

A desk. Two chairs. A computer monitor.

The officer gestured toward the chairs.

Jiawen sat.

Faris moved to sit, but Jiawen's father placed a hand lightly on his shoulder.

"Let her talk," her father murmured.

Faris froze.

Then he nodded.

Door deal.

He stepped back slightly and remained standing behind Jiawen, present but not speaking unless needed.

Jiawen took a breath.

She spoke calmly, explaining the situation: the breakup, the repeated messages, the use of new numbers, the attempt to contact cousins, the recent threat.

Her voice didn't shake.

The officer listened, typing.

When Jiawen showed the screenshots, the officer's expression tightened slightly.

"Have you responded?" he asked.

"No," Jiawen replied. "I blocked. He uses new numbers. I haven't replied."

The officer nodded.

"Any physical stalking? Has he shown up at your workplace or home?"

Jiawen hesitated.

Faris felt his stomach tighten.

Jiawen answered carefully. "He has appeared near my workplace in Singapore before, but I set boundaries and he left. Here, I don't know if he's physically here. But he is threatening to come."

The officer nodded.

"Okay," he said. "We can file a report. If he appears, you call. If he continues, you can consider a protection order. But you must keep evidence."

Jiawen nodded. "I'm keeping."

Her father's voice cut in, calm.

"If he goes to Queensbay Mall and wait, can you do something?"

The officer glanced up. "If he is there and he approaches her, and she feels threatened, she can call. But if she does not go, there is no confrontation."

Her father's jaw tightened.

Faris watched him.

The father's anger was protective.

Faris understood it.

But he also understood something else.

Junhao wanted a confrontation.

The cleanest victory was refusing to give him one.

The officer finished typing.

He printed a report and asked Jiawen to sign.

Jiawen signed with steady hand.

Then the officer said, "This is on record now."

The words landed like a small, heavy seal.

Jiawen exhaled.

Her shoulders lowered.

Outside the station, Jiawen's mother let out a breath like she had been holding it for months.

"Good," she said. "Now he cannot play."

Jiawen nodded.

Faris watched her face.

Not relief like celebration.

Relief like safety.

Jiawen's father looked at his watch.

"It's four forty-five," he said.

Jiawen's stomach tightened.

Five p.m.

Queensbay.

The time Junhao had chosen like a stage cue.

Jiawen's father's eyes narrowed.

"Maybe he will still go there," he said.

Jiawen's mother's face tightened. "Then what? We go and see?"

Jiawen turned sharply. "No."

Her voice was firm.

Her mother blinked.

Jiawen continued, voice controlled. "We don't go. We don't check. We don't give him anything."

Her father stared at her.

Then he nodded slowly.

"Okay," he said.

And for the first time, Faris heard something in his voice.

Not just acceptance.

Respect.

***

They went home.

At five o'clock, they were in Jiawen's living room.

The TV was on, volume low, some variety show playing in the background. Jiawen's mother went back to the kitchen to cook as if cooking could turn stress into normalcy. Jiawen's father sat at the dining table, arms crossed, staring at his phone like he was daring it to ring.

Jiawen sat on the sofa with her legs tucked under her, phone in her lap.

Faris sat beside her, close but not touching.

The room felt like it was holding its breath.

Jiawen's phone didn't vibrate.

Five ten.

Still nothing.

Five fifteen.

Jiawen's father's phone buzzed.

He picked it up.

His eyes narrowed.

He didn't speak.

He turned the screen toward Jiawen.

A message.

From an unknown number.

*Uncle, I am Junhao. I want to talk to you and Auntie. I come Penang because I love Jiawen. Please give me one chance. I can explain properly.*

Jiawen's face went pale.

Faris felt cold spread under his ribs.

Junhao had done it.

He had bypassed her.

Straight to the parents.

Like Jiawen was an object to be negotiated.

Jiawen's father stared at the message.

His face didn't change much.

But his jaw tightened.

Then he typed.

Faris watched the old man's thumbs move slowly, deliberately.

He didn't ask for help.

He didn't consult.

He typed like a man who had waited his whole life for a moment like this.

Jiawen leaned forward. "Pa--"

Her father lifted one hand.

"No," he said quietly.

Then he pressed send.

He turned the phone toward Jiawen.

His reply was short.

*Do not contact my daughter or my family again. She has made her decision. If you continue, we will report. Respect or face consequences.*

The words sat there.

Clean.

Not cruel.

Final.

Jiawen's throat moved.

Her eyes glistened.

Her father set the phone down.

Then he looked at Jiawen.

"You hear?" he said.

Jiawen nodded, a tear slipping out despite her effort.

Her father's voice softened. "No more. Okay?"

Jiawen nodded again.

Faris watched her.

In that moment, he felt a wave of emotion--relief, pride, something like gratitude.

Jiawen's father had closed the door.

Not for Faris.

For his daughter.

Jiawen's mother emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands.

"What?" she asked.

Jiawen's father showed her the message thread.

Jiawen's mother read it once.

Then her mouth tightened into something fierce.

"Shameless," she muttered.

She turned to Jiawen.

"You see," her mother said, voice sharp but protective, "you don't need to talk to him. We talk. We close."

Jiawen's breath shook.

She tried to laugh, but it came out as a small, broken sound.

"I didn't want you to be involved," she whispered.

Her mother sat beside her and pulled her into a hug, right there in the living room like they were not adults anymore.

"Aiya," her mother murmured, patting her hair. "You are my daughter. Of course I involved."

Jiawen's tears slipped out quietly.

Faris sat still, hands clenched loosely, feeling the urge to move and restrain himself.

He wasn't the one who needed to hold her right now.

Her mother was.

Her father was.

Faris was the steady presence beside.

After a moment, Jiawen pulled back and wiped her eyes.

She looked at Faris.

Her gaze was soft.

A small apology for crying.

Faris shook his head slightly.

No apology needed.

Jiawen's father cleared his throat.

He looked at Faris.

"You," he said.

Faris straightened. "Yes, Uncle?"

Jiawen's father stared at him for a long moment.

Then he said, quietly, "Thank you."

Faris blinked.

"For what?"

"For not making this into fight," her father replied. "For letting Jiawen decide. For being calm."

Faris felt his throat tighten.

He nodded slowly.

"It's her life," Faris said softly. "I just… stand with her."

Her father nodded.

Then he added, almost grudgingly, "You are… steady."

Jiawen let out a wet laugh.

"Pa," she protested, wiping her cheeks. "You just compliment him like that?"

Her father shrugged slightly, as if embarrassed.

Faris's mouth twitched.

Jiawen's mother sniffed and turned to Faris.

"You," she said, eyes narrowing again, "you still don't do stupid thing, okay?"

Faris blinked, then nodded obediently. "Okay, Auntie."

Jiawen laughed through her tears.

Faris felt the room loosen slightly.

The tension that had been held since morning began to dissolve.

Not because the problem was gone.

But because the door had been shut.

With record.

With family.

With consequences.

Properly.

***

Later that night, after dinner, Faris and Jiawen stood again on the balcony.

The air was cooler now, carrying the smell of rain and distant frying oil from somewhere in the neighbourhood. The city's sounds were softer, stretched thin by night.

Jiawen leaned on the railing, fingers wrapped around the handkerchief.

She had washed her face, but her eyes were still slightly puffy.

Faris stood beside her.

This time, he let their shoulders touch.

Not hidden.

Not dramatic.

Just… there.

Jiawen spoke first.

"I feel… embarrassed," she admitted softly.

Faris turned slightly. "Why?"

Jiawen's mouth tightened. "Because he messaged my father. Like I'm… property."

Faris's jaw tightened.

"You're not," he said.

"I know," Jiawen whispered. "But it still makes me feel… dirty. Like I brought something ugly into my family."

Faris exhaled slowly.

He wanted to say *you didn't bring it.*

He wanted to say *he did.*

But he knew Jiawen's feelings didn't care about logic.

So he said something else.

"You didn't bring ugliness," Faris said quietly. "You brought truth. And your family responded with… love. That's not ugly."

Jiawen stared at the dark street for a moment.

Then her voice caught slightly.

"My father's message," she whispered. "It was so… final."

Faris nodded.

Jiawen's mouth trembled. "I didn't know he would… defend me like that."

Faris glanced at her.

"He's your father," he said.

Jiawen let out a breathy laugh. "He's usually very calm. Like… newspaper and coffee only."

Faris's mouth twitched.

Jiawen continued, softer, "When he typed, I felt like… I'm not alone. Like my family is… on my side."

Faris's chest tightened.

"That's what you deserved," he said.

Jiawen looked at him.

Her eyes were wet again, but her gaze was steady.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Faris blinked. "For what?"

"For being here," Jiawen said. "Not to fight. Not to rescue. Just… to be here."

Faris swallowed.

He didn't trust his voice immediately.

So he nodded.

Jiawen's fingers tightened around the handkerchief.

Then she held it out toward him.

Faris frowned. "What?"

Jiawen's mouth twitched. "Take."

Faris hesitated.

Jiawen insisted. "Take."

Faris took the handkerchief.

Jiawen's fingers lingered on the fabric for a second, as if she didn't want to let go of the feeling.

Then she released it.

Faris held it in his palm.

Jiawen exhaled.

"That handkerchief…" she murmured. "It's like… a proof. That even when I'm shaking, I can still be… me."

Faris's throat tightened.

"It's just cloth," he said softly.

Jiawen shook her head. "It's not."

Faris looked down at it.

He thought of the orchestra night.

He thought of the corridor at the aunt's house.

He thought of her gripping it tonight while her father typed.

He understood.

It wasn't dependency.

It was ritual.

A small, controlled thing in a world that kept trying to intrude.

Jiawen leaned her head lightly against his shoulder.

Faris froze for half a second.

Then he relaxed.

In Penang's night air, with motorbikes humming in the distance, they stood and let the quiet settle.

After a moment, Jiawen spoke again.

"You know what's funny?" she murmured.

"What?"

Jiawen lifted her head and looked at him.

"He said… 'properly'," she said, voice dry.

Faris's jaw tightened.

Jiawen rolled her eyes. "As if he has the right. As if he knows what proper is."

Faris exhaled slowly.

"He doesn't," he said.

Jiawen's mouth twitched.

Then, despite everything, she smiled.

"Handsome HR," she whispered.

Faris sighed. "Stop."

"Never," Jiawen replied.

Faris's mouth twitched again.

Then Jiawen's expression softened.

"Okay," she said quietly. "So… that's closed."

Faris looked at her.

"Is it?" he asked.

Jiawen's eyes narrowed slightly.

Faris clarified gently. "Not because I don't believe you. But because… sometimes people like him try again."

Jiawen nodded.

Her voice was calm.

"Then we keep documenting," she said. "We keep record. We keep boundaries. And my family knows now."

Faris nodded.

Jiawen added softly, "He can't isolate me anymore. That's what he wanted. To make me feel alone."

Faris's chest tightened.

"Yes," he said.

Jiawen looked out into the night.

Then she whispered something that made Faris's throat tighten.

"I'm glad my parents saw you today," she said. "Not just as… my boyfriend. But as someone who respects me."

Faris's chest warmed.

He didn't know what to say.

So he said the simplest truth.

"I respect you," he murmured.

Jiawen turned back to him.

Her eyes were soft.

"I know," she whispered.

They stood in silence.

Inside, Jiawen's mother called out something in Mandarin about fruit.

Jiawen groaned. "Ma wants us to eat fruit every night like we're five."

Faris's mouth twitched. "Maybe it's good."

Jiawen looked at him with horror. "You're siding with her."

Faris shrugged, deadpan. "I'm a guest."

Jiawen snorted.

The laughter loosened the last remaining tightness in Faris' chest.

Junhao had tried to demand a scene at five p.m.

Instead, Jiawen had sat in a police station at four.

Her father had typed a final door-shut at five fifteen.

Her mother had hugged her at six.

And now, at night, she was laughing again.

Not because the past hadn't hurt.

But because the past no longer had a seat at her table.

Faris looked down at the handkerchief in his palm.

He thought of reserved seats.

Of gaps.

Of who decided where you sat.

Then he looked at Jiawen.

She was here.

Still herself.

Still choosing.

Door deal.

Meet halfway.

And for the first time since Junhao's message had arrived, Faris felt something settle.

Not relief as in "it's over."

But relief as in "we can breathe."

Tomorrow, there would still be Penang.

There would still be aunties.

There would still be questions.

But one door had been shut.

Properly.

And Faris knew, with a quiet certainty that had nothing to do with planning, that when the time came to reserve their future--when the question of engagement moved from thought to action--he would do it with the same discipline.

No scenes.

No half-measures.

No ambiguity.

Just a choice made loud enough that the past could never pretend it still belonged.
