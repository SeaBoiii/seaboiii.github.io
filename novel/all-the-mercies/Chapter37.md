# Chapter 37 -- Boundary Agreements

After the laughter came the paperwork.

Not official paperwork.

Not forms.

Not stamps.

The kind of paperwork that didn't live on paper.

The kind that lived in sentences.

Agreements.

Boundaries.

Expectations.

Because everyone could smile at dinner and still carry fear home.

Everyone could laugh over cake and still wake up at 3 a.m. with the same question:

*What happens after she becomes his wife?*

Belle learned quickly that love wasn't only about choosing each other.

Love was also about choosing what you would *not* allow to happen.

Isolation.

Possession.

Silent resentment.

In this story, the marriage didn't begin at the akad sentence.

It began at the boundary agreements.

The meeting was set at a neutral place.

A small function room at a community club.

Not a mosque.

Not anyone's house.

A space that belonged to no one.

So no one had to feel like a guest.

Ivan had suggested it.

"Neutral ground reduces power imbalance," Ivan said.

Crystal rolled her eyes.

"Why you talk like you're mediating a divorce," she muttered.

Ivan stared.

"This is prevention," Ivan replied.

Aleem had simply nodded.

"Okay," he said.

Belle had stared at him.

"Okay?" she asked.

Aleem's gaze was calm.

"It's proper," he said.

So they booked the room.

Parents from both sides.

ABIX invited, but with a clear role.

Not to speak.

To buffer.

To soften.

To make sure no one felt alone.

On the day itself, Belle arrived early with her parents.

Her mother held her handbag like a shield.

Her father walked beside her with his hands clasped behind his back.

Steady.

Belle's stomach churned.

Aleem arrived five minutes later.

His parents with him.

Mak in her usual controlled energy, eyes scanning the room.

Ayah calm, glasses on, expression neutral.

ABIX arrived last, as if on purpose.

Ivan with a folder.

Crystal with a tote bag that probably contained snacks and chaos.

Belle's eyes met Aleem's.

He nodded slightly.

Okay.

Belle inhaled.

Okay.

They sat around a long table.

Not round.

Because round felt too intimate.

Long meant structure.

A line.

Two sides.

But still connected.

Ustazah Mariam was present.

Not as a judge.

As a facilitator.

A gentle adult in the room.

She greeted everyone politely.

Then she said, calm,

"Thank you for coming. This is not to pressure anyone. This is to clarify, so there is no hidden hurt later."

Hidden hurt.

Belle's throat tightened.

Ustazah Mariam smiled.

"We will talk about visits," she said. "Family time. Expectations. And how to protect relationships."

Protect.

Not control.

Belle exhaled.

Ustazah Mariam asked a simple opening question.

"What is everyone most afraid of?"

The room froze.

No one wanted to go first.

Because naming fear made it real.

Crystal's hand shot up.

Everyone turned.

Crystal blinked.

Then she lowered her hand slowly.

"Sorry," she whispered. "Habit."

Ivan coughed.

Ustazah Mariam smiled.

"It's okay," she said gently. "But I'd like the parents to speak first."

Belle's mother swallowed.

Belle's father's jaw tightened.

Mak's eyes narrowed.

Ayah's gaze remained calm.

Finally, Belle's father spoke.

His voice was quiet.

"I am afraid she will disappear," Belle's father said.

The sentence landed like a stone.

Belle's chest tightened.

Belle's mother's eyes filled.

Belle's father continued,

"I am afraid she becomes wife and forgets she is daughter."

Belle's throat tightened.

Mak inhaled sharply.

Ayah's gaze softened slightly.

Ustazah Mariam nodded.

"Thank you," she said.

Then she looked at Mak.

Mak's mouth tightened.

She didn't like emotional questions.

But she answered anyway.

"I am afraid she will not be sincere," Mak said, voice blunt. "I am afraid she say she believe but actually she only want my son."

Belle's stomach dropped.

Aleem's jaw tightened.

Belle's mother flinched.

Belle's father's eyes sharpened.

The air tensed.

Ustazah Mariam nodded calmly.

"Thank you for honesty," she said.

Mak's eyes flicked to Belle.

Then Mak added quickly, softer,

"But… I can see she is kind. I can see she tries. So my fear is smaller now. But still there."

Smaller.

Still there.

Belle's throat tightened.

Ayah spoke next, calm.

"I am afraid people will hurt them," Ayah said. "Community comments. Family gossip. Pressure."

Belle's chest tightened.

Aleem nodded slightly.

Yes.

Ustazah Mariam looked at Belle's mother.

Belle's mother swallowed.

Her voice came out thick.

"I am afraid… I will lose her," Belle's mother whispered. "Not only physically. Like… emotionally. Like her heart becomes another place."

Belle's chest cracked.

Her mother continued,

"And I am afraid I will become… inconvenient."

Inconvenient.

Belle's throat tightened.

Ustazah Mariam nodded.

"Thank you," she said.

Then she looked at Aleem.

"Aleem," she said gently, "what are you afraid of?"

Aleem's throat moved.

He didn't like talking about fear.

But he didn't avoid it.

"I am afraid of harming them," Aleem admitted quietly. "Her parents. My parents. Belle."

Belle's eyes stung.

Aleem continued,

"And I am afraid of resentment," he said. "If we don't set things properly, resentment will grow silently."

Resentment.

Ustazah Mariam nodded.

"That is wise," she said.

Belle's stomach churned.

Then Ustazah Mariam looked at Belle.

"And you, Belle?"

Belle swallowed.

All eyes on her.

She breathed.

"I am afraid of being the reason everyone hurts," Belle whispered. "And… I'm afraid of failing. Of disappointing both sides."

Silence.

Ustazah Mariam nodded.

"Okay," she said softly.

The word soothed.

Okay.

Then they moved from fear to agreements.

Ustazah Mariam wrote on a whiteboard.

Not legal.

But clear.

**1) Visits & Family Time**

Ustazah Mariam asked, "What is realistic?"

Belle's father spoke first.

"Sundays," he said. "At least twice a month. Dinner."

Mak frowned.

"Sunday is family day," Mak said.

Belle's father's gaze sharpened.

"Yes," he said. "That's why."

The tension sharpened.

Aleem's jaw tightened.

Then Ayah spoke calmly.

"We can alternate," Ayah said. "One Sunday her side, one Sunday our side. Or we do lunch her side, dinner our side."

Belle blinked.

Ayah was negotiating.

Not fighting.

Belle's mother's eyes filled.

Mak looked annoyed.

But Mak nodded reluctantly.

"Okay," Mak muttered. "Alternate. But no last-minute cancel."

Belle's father nodded.

"Okay," he said.

Okay.

An agreement formed.

**Alternate Sundays.**

No one disappeared.

**2) Communication**

Belle's mother spoke softly.

"I want… calls," she said. "Not only text."

Belle's throat tightened.

"Yes," Belle whispered.

Mak huffed.

"You can call," Mak said. "Why you need permission."

Belle's mother blinked.

Mak continued, voice blunt,

"She is your daughter. You call."

Belle's mother's eyes filled.

"Okay," Belle's mother whispered.

Mak rolled her eyes.

"Okay," Mak muttered.

**Calls are normal.**

Not suspicious.

Not judged.

**3) Religious boundaries**

This part tightened the room.

Because this was where people imagined loss.

Ustazah Mariam spoke gently.

"Belle's parents will still have their practices," she said. "And Belle will have hers. The question is respect."

Mak nodded.

"Respect," Mak said.

Belle's father asked, calm,

"Can we still celebrate Chinese New Year?"

Aleem nodded.

"Yes," Aleem said. "As cultural. No worship. We can visit. Eat together. Show respect."

Belle's father's jaw loosened slightly.

Mak added quickly,

"But no incense for Belle," Mak said.

Belle's father's eyes sharpened.

Belle's stomach tightened.

Aleem raised his hand slightly.

"Uncle," Aleem said, respectful, "we can discuss in detail later. But yes, Belle will avoid religious worship. But she can still honour elders with bows, with tea, with presence."

Belle's father stared.

Then he nodded slowly.

"Okay," her father said.

Mak nodded.

"Okay," Mak replied.

Not perfect.

But clear.

**4) Protection from external comments**

Ayah spoke calmly.

"We agree," Ayah said. "No one pressures Belle. No one asks intrusive questions. If anyone asks, Aleem answers."

Belle's chest tightened.

Mak nodded sharply.

"Yes," Mak said. "If aunties ask, I scold."

Belle's mother blinked.

Mak's voice softened awkwardly.

"If your relatives ask you also can scold," Mak added. "Not only us."

Belle's mother let out a watery laugh.

"I can't scold like you," Belle's mother whispered.

Mak frowned.

"You can learn," Mak said.

Crystal made a small choked sound.

Ivan shot her a look.

Crystal pressed her lips together.

But her eyes were smiling.

Belle's father exhaled.

"Okay," her father said.

**Aleem shields. Parents back him.**

A wall built.

**5) Alone time**

Ustazah Mariam added this herself.

"Marriage needs space," she said. "So we need to agree on boundaries for privacy."

Belle's mother's face tightened.

Mak's face tightened.

The mothers, suddenly united.

Ustazah Mariam smiled.

"Not isolation," she clarified. "Just… healthy couple time."

Ayah nodded.

"Yes," Ayah said. "They need time."

Belle's father nodded slowly.

"Yes," he said. "But not disappear."

Aleem nodded.

"No disappear," Aleem said.

Mak huffed.

"Okay," Mak muttered. "One weekday is couple. Sunday is family."

Ivan's eyes lit up.

"That is a clear rule," Ivan said.

Crystal leaned toward him.

"You're enjoying this," she whispered.

Ivan ignored her.

Belle's mouth twitched.

Okay.

A structure.

By the end, the whiteboard was full.

Not perfect harmony.

But agreements.

Everyone looked tired.

Emotionally wrung.

But something had shifted.

Not all fears gone.

But named.

Held.

Ustazah Mariam closed the session gently.

"These agreements are not cages," she said. "They are bridges. You can adjust as life changes. But the intention must remain: love without taking."

Love without taking.

Belle's throat tightened.

Her father nodded once.

Mak exhaled.

Ayah's gaze softened.

Belle's mother wiped her eyes.

Aleem stared at the whiteboard, jaw tight.

Then he looked at Belle.

"You okay?" he murmured.

Belle nodded.

"Yes," she whispered. "Tired. But… okay."

Aleem nodded.

"Okay," he echoed.

After the meeting, in the carpark, Belle's father walked up to Mak.

Belle's stomach tightened.

Mak's eyes narrowed.

Two parents.

Two protectors.

Belle held her breath.

Belle's father spoke calmly.

"Thank you," her father said. "For agreeing to alternate."

Mak blinked.

She didn't like gratitude.

It made her feel soft.

Mak cleared her throat.

"Okay lah," Mak muttered. "We also don't want trouble."

Belle's father nodded.

Then he said, quietly,

"Also… thank you for defending Belle at the wedding."

Mak froze.

Belle's throat tightened.

Mak's face shifted.

Awkward.

Soft.

Mak huffed.

"Aiyo," Mak muttered. "People talk too much."

Belle's father nodded.

"Yes," he agreed.

A pause.

Then Belle's father added,

"We both protect our children."

Mak's eyes shimmered.

She blinked fast.

"Okay," Mak whispered.

Belle's father nodded.

"Okay," he replied.

Two protectors.

Not enemies.

Allies.

On the way home, Belle sat beside Aleem.

Her head leaned against the window.

Her chest felt heavy.

But it wasn't the heaviness of doom.

It was the heaviness of something real being built.

"Was that okay?" Belle asked softly.

Aleem glanced at her.

His gaze was steady.

"Yes," he said. "That was… very okay."

Belle exhaled.

Aleem's voice was low.

"This is what proper looks like," he said. "Not romance. Not grand gestures. Adults making agreements so love can survive."

Belle's throat tightened.

She whispered,

"Okay."

Aleem nodded.

"Okay."

And for the first time, Belle felt the structure of their future settle into place.

Not as a cage.

As a bridge.

One boundary agreement at a time.
