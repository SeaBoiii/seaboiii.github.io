# Chapter 9 -- The Feminine Drift

After Mei Xuan said she had always known, something strange happened to the air between them.

It stopped feeling like a tightrope.

Wei Ling had spent months balancing--mask on, mask off--expecting every step to snap. He had lived in the constant dread of a single wrong angle, a single careless sound, a single touch that would reveal too much.

But the moment Mei Xuan called him *Chen Wei* and still stayed, the tightrope became… ground.

Not perfectly stable.

Not safe in the way fairy tales promised.

But steady enough to stand.

The next few days weren't a dramatic montage. They were ordinary in the way real love often was--stitched together with routines, quick texts, shared meals, and the quiet decisions you made again and again.

Stay.

Be honest.

Don't run.

Wei Ling learned that honesty didn't mean telling the whole world.

It meant telling Mei Xuan.

And letting her see him without flinching.

Their relationship started living in the small spaces first.

Under tables.

In corridors.

In the gap between lectures when everyone was too busy rushing to notice how Mei Xuan's fingers brushed Wei Ling's wrist.

In a crowded cafeteria line where Mei Xuan stood behind him, close enough that her breath warmed his shoulder.

Wei Ling would tense instinctively.

Mei Xuan would lean in and murmur, "Relax."

And like a command, his body would soften.

Sometimes it annoyed him how easily she had that effect.

Sometimes it thrilled him.

Most of the time, it scared him.

Because control--being controlled--was something his body recognized as safety now.

And safety was addictive.

Their friends noticed, of course.

Shu Wen noticed first.

She didn't notice in a subtle way.

She noticed in the way Shu Wen did everything--with the energy of someone who thought gossip was a form of exercise.

One afternoon, Wei Ling was sitting with Aina, Shu Wen, and Kavitha in the library corner, trying to pretend his textbook wasn't blurred by the thought of Mei Xuan.

Mei Xuan texted:

*You free after this?*

Wei Ling replied:

*Ya.*

Then:

*Where?*

Mei Xuan:

*My place. Bring your notes. And don't be late.*

Wei Ling smiled without meaning to.

Shu Wen's head snapped up like she could smell it.

"EH," she said loudly.

Wei Ling almost dropped his phone.

Aina blinked. "What?"

Shu Wen leaned across the table, grinning like a villain.

"You smiling at your phone like that means one thing," she said. "Mei Xuan, right?"

Wei Ling's face heated.

Kavitha didn't look up from her laptop, but her mouth curved faintly.

Aina's eyes widened.

Wei Ling tried to act calm.

"Why you so noisy," he muttered.

Shu Wen gasped dramatically. "Wah. Confirm."

Wei Ling hissed, "Shh."

Shu Wen lowered her voice only slightly.

"So… official already?" she whispered.

Wei Ling swallowed.

Official.

The word felt too big.

Like it would summon consequences.

He glanced at Aina.

Aina was watching him with a softness that surprised him.

"Eh," Aina said quietly, "if you happy, then okay la."

Wei Ling blinked.

Shu Wen's eyes gleamed. "Aina so supportive. See? This hostel girls all best."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Hostel girls.

The phrase still made him flinch internally.

But now, instead of shame, it stirred something else.

A longing.

Not to deceive.

To belong.

Kavitha finally looked up.

She studied Wei Ling for a second, calm and too perceptive.

"Just… be careful," she said.

Wei Ling's stomach tightened.

"Careful?" Shu Wen echoed, confused.

Kavitha shrugged. "People talk."

Mei Xuan's voice echoed in Wei Ling's mind.

*This is Malaysia. Campus people talk. We do it smart.*

Wei Ling nodded slowly.

"Ya," he said.

Kavitha's gaze held him for a beat longer than necessary.

Then she looked back down.

Wei Ling didn't know if she suspected something deeper.

He didn't ask.

He wasn't sure he wanted the answer.

Mei Xuan became… strategic.

Not in a manipulative way.

In the way she approached everything--like she refused to let emotion make her careless.

She started choosing where they met.

Not too isolated.

Not too public.

Corners with exits.

Cafés where the staff didn't stare.

Study rooms where the door could lock.

She started setting rules that sounded bossy but felt like shelter.

"No coming to my hostel in daylight," she said.

Wei Ling bristled.

"Why?"

Mei Xuan stared at him.

"Because you like to panic," she said flatly. "At night, less people. Less eyes."

Wei Ling muttered, "I don't panic."

Mei Xuan raised an eyebrow.

Wei Ling swallowed his pride.

He did panic.

Mei Xuan continued, voice calmer.

"And don't linger outside. You come in, you come in. You leave, you leave. No standing at gate like lost puppy."

Wei Ling's face heated.

"I'm not puppy," he muttered.

Mei Xuan smirked.

"Maybe."

Wei Ling glared.

Mei Xuan's smirk deepened.

"Okay la," she said, and tugged his sleeve gently. "Come."

He hated how easily that tug turned him obedient.

He also loved it.

It was terrifying.

One weekend, Mei Xuan took him shopping.

Not to a mall like a date movie.

To places that felt real--Guardian, Watsons, small boutiques where the lighting was unforgiving, a cheap accessories stall where everything sparkled under fluorescent lights.

Wei Ling followed her like a shadow.

Not because he wanted to be a shadow.

Because he didn't know how to exist in public as himself.

Mei Xuan moved with calm confidence, picking up items, reading labels, making quick decisions.

"This cleanser," she said, holding up a bottle. "Your skin too sensitive for harsh one."

Wei Ling blinked. "You know my skin?"

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes. "I can see la. Your cheeks always red."

Wei Ling's face heated.

Mei Xuan tossed the bottle into the basket.

"And this," she added, grabbing cotton pads.

Wei Ling stared.

Mei Xuan glanced at him.

"What you staring? You think makeup remove with prayers ah?"

Wei Ling laughed despite himself.

The laughter made him feel lighter.

For a moment, he forgot he was pretending.

He was just… a person buying things with someone who cared.

At a small cosmetics counter, Mei Xuan tested a lip tint on her wrist.

Then she shoved the tester toward Wei Ling.

"Try," she said.

Wei Ling hesitated.

"Here?" he whispered.

Mei Xuan looked unimpressed.

"You scared of what? Auntie police?" she asked.

Wei Ling's cheeks burned.

Mei Xuan leaned in, voice low.

"Look at me," she said.

Wei Ling did.

Mei Xuan's gaze was steady.

"You're fine," she murmured. "You're not doing wrong."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded.

His hand lifted.

He applied the tint carefully.

Mei Xuan watched.

Then she tilted her head.

"Nice," she said.

Wei Ling's breath caught.

Nice.

Such a small word.

It landed like permission.

Mei Xuan paid without hesitation.

Outside, Wei Ling held the shopping bag and tried not to look like he was floating.

Mei Xuan nudged him with her shoulder.

"Don't smile so much," she said.

Wei Ling blinked. "Why?"

Mei Xuan smirked. "Because I know what you thinking."

Wei Ling's face flared hot.

"What I thinking?"

Mei Xuan leaned in close enough that he could smell her shampoo.

"You happy," she whispered.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan pulled back and walked ahead as if she hadn't just dismantled him with one sentence.

Wei Ling followed, heart pounding.

He realized, with a shock that felt like stepping into cold water:

He *was* happy.

Not just because Mei Xuan wanted him.

Because being Wei Ling--moving through the world like this--was starting to feel like relief.

That realization scared him more than anything.

In the weeks that followed, Wei Ling spent more time as Wei Ling.

Not only when he left his room.

Not only when he met Mei Xuan.

Sometimes he would sit alone at his desk with the wig on, makeup done, wearing a loose skirt, reading notes he didn't absorb.

He would catch his reflection in the dark window and feel a warmth stir in his chest.

Then guilt would arrive like it always did.

*You're lying.*

*You're stealing space.*

*You're a boy in a costume.*

But now there was another voice too.

Quieter.

Stubborn.

*You're breathing.*

Wei Ling didn't know which voice was truth.

He only knew he was tired of suffocating.

One night, after Mei Xuan fell asleep beside him, Wei Ling lay awake and watched her face.

She looked different when she slept.

Softer.

Less guarded.

Wei Ling's chest tightened.

He whispered, almost inaudible:

"Why you so good to me?"

Mei Xuan didn't answer.

She was asleep.

But her hand, even in sleep, tightened around his wrist as if she heard the question anyway.

Wei Ling stared at the ceiling and felt something unfamiliar.

Hope.

Not the fragile hope he had carried as a boy.

A heavier hope.

A hope that asked for responsibility.

Because being loved like this meant he couldn't keep living like a lie.

Not with her.

Not with himself.

The first time they went out "as a couple" in daylight was an accident.

They were at a café near campus--one of those quiet places with too many plants and music that pretended not to exist.

They had chosen it because it was calm.

Because people mind their own business.

Because Mei Xuan said, "Here okay."

Wei Ling believed her.

They sat side by side this time, not across.

Mei Xuan had her laptop open.

Wei Ling pretended to read.

He wasn't.

He was watching the way Mei Xuan's fingers tapped the table when she was thinking.

The way she frowned at her screen.

The way she occasionally glanced at him like she was checking he hadn't vanished.

Wei Ling's chest tightened.

He reached out under the table and brushed his pinky against hers.

Mei Xuan's fingers stilled.

Then her pinky hooked his.

Wei Ling's breath caught.

Mei Xuan didn't look at him.

She didn't smile.

She just kept typing, as if holding his hand was the most normal thing in the world.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

A couple at the next table laughed.

A group of students walked past.

Nobody screamed.

Nobody pointed.

Wei Ling realized his fear had been inventing a crowd that didn't exist.

Mei Xuan leaned in, voice low.

"You okay?"

Wei Ling nodded.

"Yes," he whispered.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed slightly.

"Use your words," she reminded.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"I'm okay," he repeated.

Mei Xuan's lips curved faintly.

"Good," she murmured.

Then, without looking at him, she tugged his hand closer.

Just a little.

Like she was claiming him quietly.

Wei Ling's skin warmed.

He felt something shift.

Not because of the touch.

Because he wasn't hiding.

Not fully.

He was just… there.

Existing.

Being held.

Rumours arrived the way they always did.

Not like thunder.

Like drizzle.

Soft at first.

Then constant.

Wei Ling didn't hear them directly.

He felt them.

The glances that lingered.

The sudden hush when he and Mei Xuan walked past.

The way people's eyes flicked from Mei Xuan to him and back.

One afternoon, Shu Wen barged into Wei Ling's corner at the library and plopped down dramatically.

"Okay," she whispered. "I have news."

Wei Ling's stomach tightened.

"What?"

Shu Wen grinned. "People say Mei Xuan got girlfriend already."

Wei Ling's chest tightened.

Shu Wen waggled her eyebrows. "And they say the girlfriend very pretty."

Wei Ling's face heated.

"Shut up," he muttered.

Aina, sitting beside him, rolled her eyes.

"Shu Wen, you so free," she said.

Shu Wen shrugged. "I just report la. Don't shoot messenger."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Kavitha, across the table, glanced up.

Her gaze was calm.

"Rumours can be dangerous," she said quietly.

Shu Wen scoffed. "Aiya, two girls holding hands only. People like to talk."

Kavitha's gaze stayed steady.

"Exactly," she said.

Wei Ling swallowed.

Mei Xuan's rule echoed again.

*We do it smart.*

That night, Wei Ling told Mei Xuan.

Not because he wanted to panic.

Because he promised no more pretending.

Mei Xuan listened without interrupting.

Then she nodded.

"Okay," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

"That's all?" he asked.

Mei Xuan glanced at him, unimpressed.

"What you want me do? Fight rumours?" she asked.

Wei Ling swallowed.

Mei Xuan's expression softened slightly.

"People will talk," she said. "We can't control. We only control us."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

"And if… if it become dangerous?" he asked.

Mei Xuan's eyes sharpened.

"Then we adjust," she said simply. "We don't act stupid. We don't put you in risk."

The word *you* hit Wei Ling's chest.

She didn't say *us.*

She said *you.*

Because she knew.

Because she understood the danger wasn't equal.

Wei Ling swallowed.

He nodded.

Mei Xuan reached out and tugged him closer by the sleeve.

Wei Ling fell against her shoulder.

Mei Xuan's fingers combed through the wig-hair near his ear.

"You trust me or not?" she asked.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

"Yes," he whispered.

Mei Xuan hummed.

"Good," she said.

Then, quieter:

"And you trust yourself also."

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan sighed. "Don't blink."

Wei Ling laughed softly.

But his eyes stung.

Because trusting himself was the hardest part.

The first time Wei Ling went without the wig was also an accident.

Not outside.

Not in public.

In Mei Xuan's room.

He had taken it off because his scalp hurt.

Because the day had been too long.

Because he wanted to breathe.

His real hair was longer now--past his ears, soft from conditioner, curling slightly at the ends.

Not feminine.

Not yet.

But no longer the boy-cut the kampung had forced on him.

Mei Xuan looked up from her phone and stared.

Wei Ling froze.

"What?" he asked, suddenly insecure.

Mei Xuan didn't answer immediately.

Then she said, quietly, "Nice."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan stood and walked over.

She lifted her hand and ran her fingers through his hair.

Wei Ling shivered.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed, amused.

"Sensitive," she murmured.

Wei Ling's face heated.

Mei Xuan leaned in and kissed him--soft, brief, more affection than hunger.

Then she stepped back and looked at him like she was seeing him again.

"You like being like this?" she asked.

Wei Ling swallowed.

He didn't want to lie.

He didn't want to hide.

So he told the truth.

"Yes," he whispered.

Mei Xuan nodded.

"Okay," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan sighed. "Stop blinking."

Wei Ling laughed, breathless.

Mei Xuan's lips curved.

"Then we make it better," she said.

Wei Ling's heart kicked.

"Better?"

Mei Xuan smirked.

"Hair," she said. "Clothes. Everything. If you want to be Wei Ling, then be properly."

Wei Ling's chest tightened.

Properly.

The word hit him with unexpected weight.

Not as judgment.

As care.

As commitment.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"What about Chen Wei?" he asked quietly.

Mei Xuan's smirk faded.

Her gaze sharpened.

"Chen Wei is still inside," she said. "I'm not killing him."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan sat beside him.

Her voice lowered.

"But you also don't have to keep him as a cage," she added.

Wei Ling stared.

The sentence landed in him like a stone dropped into water.

A ripple.

Then deeper ripples.

He thought of the ache.

The door.

The afterglow.

The feeling of being called *kak.*

The feeling of being held.

He swallowed.

"I don't know what I am," he admitted.

Mei Xuan hummed.

"Good," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes. "Don't blink."

Wei Ling laughed, then his laugh broke into something softer.

Mei Xuan's hand found his and squeezed.

"Not knowing means you can find out," she said.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

"And I'm here," she added.

Wei Ling looked at her.

He believed her.

Not because she said it.

Because she had already proved it.

That night, after Mei Xuan fell asleep, Wei Ling lay awake again.

He stared at the ceiling.

He listened to Mei Xuan's breathing.

He thought about how the campus had started whispering.

How their friends had started smiling knowingly.

How the world was beginning to see them as a couple.

A WLW couple.

And underneath that public label was a private truth that didn't fit cleanly into any box.

Wei Ling pressed a hand to his chest.

He could feel the pulse there.

The place where fear lived.

The place where hope was starting to grow anyway.

He thought about the plan.

The original, ugly plan.

He had come here to be loved.

But now he was learning something harder.

Being loved meant becoming honest.

Not just to Mei Xuan.

To himself.

Wei Ling turned his head and looked at Mei Xuan's sleeping face.

He whispered into the dark:

"I'll try."

Mei Xuan didn't answer.

But her hand--still resting near his--shifted slightly, fingers brushing his.

Wei Ling closed his eyes.

For the first time, the drift didn't feel like losing himself.

It felt like moving toward something he had always wanted but never believed he deserved.

Not just love.

A home.
