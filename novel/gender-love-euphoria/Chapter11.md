# Chapter 11 -- The First Bra

They hadn't made the decision overnight.

After Chapter 10, Mei Xuan did what Mei Xuan always did when she cared: she researched until her eyes were tired, then made him sit down and listen.

Not in a controlling way.

In a *don't-be-stupid* way.

She dragged him to the campus counselling services first.

Wei Ling hated the idea.

He hated the thought of sitting in a room with a stranger and admitting that his entire life had become a question.

But Mei Xuan sat beside him in the waiting area, knee pressed against his, calm as stone.

"You don't have to say everything," she murmured, voice low. "Just start somewhere."

Wei Ling swallowed.

"Why you so sure?" he asked.

Mei Xuan didn't look at him.

"Because if you keep everything inside, you will explode," she said.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Then she added, quieter:

"And I don't want to pick up your pieces."

It should have sounded harsh.

It sounded like love.

So he went.

Not because he was brave.

Because he was tired of pretending bravery meant suffering alone.

The counsellor didn't give him a label.

Didn't tell him what he "was."

She just asked questions.

Gentle ones.

Annoying ones.

The kind that made Wei Ling's throat tighten because the answers were buried under years of "normal."

When Wei Ling said, haltingly, that presenting as Wei Ling made him feel relief, the counsellor nodded as if relief was a valid reason to exist.

When Wei Ling admitted he was afraid of Malaysia, afraid of the rules and the eyes and the whispering, the counsellor didn't dismiss it.

She validated it.

And then she did something Wei Ling didn't expect.

She asked him what safety looked like.

Not abstractly.

Practically.

Who he trusted.

Where he lived.

What he would do if someone confronted him.

Wei Ling left the session feeling wrung out.

Mei Xuan met him outside, took one look at his face, and tugged him toward a quiet stairwell.

"You okay?" she asked.

Wei Ling laughed weakly.

"No," he admitted.

Mei Xuan nodded.

"Good," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes. "Don't blink."

Wei Ling's laugh broke into something softer.

Mei Xuan's hand squeezed his.

"Not okay means you told the truth," she murmured.

The counsellor wasn't the final step.

Mei Xuan didn't treat it like one.

It was just a foundation.

After that, Mei Xuan brought him to a clinic--private, discreet, the kind of place where people went for all sorts of things and nobody asked questions out loud.

Wei Ling's stomach had been in knots the entire ride.

Mei Xuan didn't hold his hand in public.

She didn't need to.

Her presence beside him was enough.

When they spoke to a doctor, Mei Xuan let Wei Ling talk first.

Wei Ling's voice shook.

He hated that.

But he spoke anyway.

He said he was questioning.

He said he had been presenting as a girl on campus.

He said he wanted to understand what medical transition looked like, what it meant, what risks existed.

The doctor didn't laugh.

Didn't moralize.

He spoke clinically, carefully, like he had had this conversation before.

Assessment.

Monitoring.

Blood work.

The importance of doing it properly.

Mei Xuan's gaze stayed sharp the whole time.

When Wei Ling drifted into panic, Mei Xuan asked practical questions.

Safety.

Timeline.

Side effects.

Support.

Wei Ling didn't understand everything, but he understood the most important part:

Nothing about this was casual.

Nothing about this was a shortcut.

It was a decision.

A slow one.

A real one.

They didn't start that day.

Mei Xuan insisted on time.

"You don't decide when your heart racing like dying," she said later, when they sat in a café with iced drinks sweating on the table.

Wei Ling stared at his cup.

"If I decide later, I will chicken out," he admitted.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed.

"Then decide with your brain also, not just fear," she said.

Wei Ling hated how right she was.

So he took time.

Two weeks.

Two weeks of reading.

Two weeks of journaling in the privacy of his room.

Two weeks of asking himself the same question in different ways:

Do you want this because of Mei Xuan?

Or because of you?

Wei Ling thought about the cashier calling him *kak.*

Thought about how his chest loosened when someone saw him as Wei Ling.

Thought about how he missed his own hair when he used to hide it under a wig.

Thought about how his old name--Chen Wei--had started sounding like someone else's clothes.

And then he thought about a simpler truth.

He didn't want to go back.

Not back to the boyhood that felt like choking.

Not back to the version of him that disappeared.

So he went back to the clinic.

This time, when the doctor asked if he was sure he wanted to begin, Wei Ling's answer was quiet.

But it didn't shake.

"Yes," he said.

Mei Xuan didn't smile.

She didn't celebrate.

She just reached down under the table and hooked her finger under his.

A grounding touch.

A promise.

The first weeks didn't look like anything dramatic.

Wei Ling expected to wake up different.

He didn't.

He still had to shave.

Still had to practice his voice.

Still had to choose his clothes carefully.

Still had to swallow fear in hallways.

But there were small shifts.

His skin felt drier at first, then softer.

His emotions hit differently--not weaker, not "more feminine" the way people liked to stereotype, but… closer to the surface.

Like there was less distance between what he felt and what he admitted.

He cried once over something stupid--an advertisement video with a sentimental song--and stared at the tears on his fingers as if they belonged to someone else.

He texted Mei Xuan:

*I just cried.*

Mei Xuan replied:

*Congratulations. Human.*

Wei Ling laughed so hard he almost cried again.

Then he texted:

*Shut up.*

Mei Xuan:

*Stop being dramatic. Drink water.*

The conversations were ordinary.

That's what made them precious.

---------

Wei Ling stopped needing the wig the way you stopped needing training wheels.

Not all at once.

Not with a dramatic declaration.

Just… one morning, he put the wig on, stared at himself, and felt the wrongness like grit between his teeth.

His own hair had reached his shoulders now--soft from conditioner, heavier at the ends, the kind of length that made his reflection look calmer even before makeup. Hormones didn't work like magic, but time did. Patience did. Routine did.

He learned how to part it properly. Learned how to tuck the front pieces behind his ears so he looked less like someone hiding. Learned which hair clip didn't look childish, which one looked effortless.

The first time he went to class without a wig, he expected to be struck by lightning.

Nothing happened.

No one screamed.

No one pointed.

A girl at the staircase glanced at him and said, "Morning, kak," and kept walking.

Wei Ling stood there with his books hugged to his chest, heart thundering, and felt that familiar electricity bloom under his skin.

*Kak.*

He didn't answer--his voice still betrayed him when he got startled--but he nodded.

And the world moved on.

That was the quiet cruelty and mercy of it.

The world didn't pause.

It just watched sometimes.

And learned you.

The first sign of change wasn't visual.

It wasn't the mirror.

It wasn't the way his clothes sat.

It was pain.

A dull, unfamiliar tenderness that bloomed under his chest like a bruise you couldn't remember earning.

Wei Ling noticed it one morning when he was pulling on a top in his single room, half-asleep, moving too quickly. Fabric dragged over him and he flinched so hard he hissed.

"Wah," he muttered, pressing a palm flat over himself.

The ache pulsed under his skin.

Not sharp.

Not unbearable.

Just… awake.

A reminder.

His heart kicked.

He stood very still, fingers splayed against his own chest, and waited for the sensation to fade.

It didn't.

It sat there, quiet but insistent.

Like the body was clearing its throat.

Like it wanted to say something.

Wei Ling stared at his reflection in the mirror.

He looked the same.

Still Chen Wei beneath the surface.

Still the same jawline.

Still the same shoulders.

But his eyes looked different--wide, bright, slightly haunted.

He whispered, as if saying it too loudly would make it disappear:

"It's starting."

He didn't know if he meant his body.

Or his life.

Or both.

Then the tenderness continued.

That dull ache.

The sensitivity that made him flinch when fabric dragged the wrong way.

The way his chest felt… awake.

Wei Ling didn't tell anyone at first.

Not even Mei Xuan.

He didn't want to jinx it.

He didn't want to admit how badly he wanted it to be real.

But the discomfort became obvious.

One night, he was in Mei Xuan's room, half lying on her bed while she sat at her desk reading.

Wei Ling shifted, trying to find a comfortable position.

Mei Xuan glanced over.

"You got ants?" she asked.

Wei Ling muttered, "No."

Mei Xuan stared.

Wei Ling tried to pretend the ache wasn't blooming under his skin like a secret.

Mei Xuan watched him for a beat.

Then she stood, walked over, and sat beside him.

Her hand landed lightly on his chest--over the fabric.

Wei Ling froze.

Heat spiked.

Not only arousal.

A startled tenderness.

Mei Xuan's brows lifted.

"Ah," she murmured.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan's fingers pressed gently.

Wei Ling flinched.

Mei Xuan's eyes sharpened.

"Sensitive," she observed.

Wei Ling's face burned.

He looked away.

Mei Xuan's hand stayed there for a second longer, then lifted.

"Since when?" she asked.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"Few days," he admitted.

Mei Xuan's mouth curved slightly.

"Why you never tell?" she asked, annoyed.

Wei Ling muttered, "Embarrassing."

Mei Xuan scoffed.

"You think I never see body before?" she asked.

Wei Ling's face went hotter.

Mei Xuan's smirk deepened.

Then she sobered.

"You okay?" she asked, voice lower.

Wei Ling nodded.

"Okay," he whispered.

Mei Xuan narrowed her eyes.

"Use your words properly," she said.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"I'm okay," he repeated.

Mei Xuan hummed, satisfied.

Then she leaned in and kissed his forehead.

A small gesture.

More intimate than anything else.

"We need to buy you something," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

"What?"

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes.

"A bra," she said like it was obvious.

Wei Ling went still.

The word landed heavy.

A bra wasn't a wig.

It wasn't makeup.

A bra was… acknowledgment.

An admission that his body was changing enough to require support.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

"I don't--" he began.

Mei Xuan cut him off.

"You do," she said.

Wei Ling swallowed.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed.

"You want to keep wincing every time cloth touch you?" she asked.

Wei Ling didn't answer.

Mei Xuan leaned closer, voice low.

"And you deserve to feel comfortable," she added.

Deserve.

Wei Ling wasn't used to that word being applied to him.

Mei Xuan stood.

"Saturday," she said. "We go."

Wei Ling's heart pounded.

"Where?"

Mei Xuan's lips curved.

"Mall," she said. "And don't start acting like you never buy bra before."

Wei Ling froze.

Mei Xuan's eyes sharpened.

"You think I don't know you used to wear those big one for the silicone?" she asked, tone flat.

Wei Ling's face went hot.

Mei Xuan smirked.

"This time different," she said, voice softer. "This time for you."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded.

"Okay," he whispered.

Mei Xuan's eyes gleamed.

"Good boy," she said casually.

Wei Ling groaned into his pillow.

Mei Xuan laughed.

Saturday arrived too fast.

Wei Ling stood in his room staring at his wardrobe like it contained landmines.

He couldn't dress too pretty.

He couldn't dress too plain.

He wanted to look like Wei Ling.

A real Wei Ling.

He settled on something simple: a loose blouse that didn't cling, a skirt, sneakers.

He wore light makeup.

No wig.

His own shoulder-length hair was clipped back neatly.

He kept the mask.

Not because he wanted to hide.

Because crowds still made him feel too visible.

When he met Mei Xuan outside the mall entrance, Mei Xuan looked him up and down.

Wei Ling's stomach dropped.

"What?" he asked quickly.

Mei Xuan tilted her head.

"Okay," she said.

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan sighed. "Don't blink."

Then she added, quieter:

"You look… pretty."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He didn't know what to do with the warmth that flooded him.

So he muttered, "Your face also okay."

Mei Xuan snorted.

"Only okay?" she asked.

Wei Ling shrugged.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed.

"You die," she said.

Wei Ling laughed despite himself.

They walked into the mall.

The air-conditioning hit them like a wave.

The mall was loud--families, teenagers, couples.

Wei Ling's anxiety flared instantly.

Too many eyes.

Too many mirrors.

Too many chances for someone to recognize Chen Wei inside Wei Ling.

Mei Xuan didn't hold his hand.

She didn't need to.

She walked beside him with her shoulder close enough to be a barrier.

When Wei Ling slowed, Mei Xuan nudged him forward.

"Walk," she murmured.

Wei Ling swallowed.

He walked.

They reached a lingerie store.

Bright lights.

Soft music.

Mannequins in lace that made Wei Ling feel like he was intruding.

He froze at the entrance.

Mei Xuan glanced back.

"What?"

Wei Ling's mouth went dry.

"People will… look," he whispered.

Mei Xuan's expression turned flat.

"Let them," she said.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan stepped closer, voice low.

"Look at me," she said.

Wei Ling did.

Mei Xuan's gaze was steady.

"You're not doing wrong," she murmured. "You're buying clothes."

Clothes.

She made it simple.

Wei Ling nodded.

Mei Xuan tugged his sleeve.

"Come," she said.

He followed.

A sales assistant approached--smiling, polite.

"Hi kak, can I help you?"

Wei Ling's stomach flipped at the word.

Mei Xuan answered first.

"Need bra," she said bluntly.

The assistant blinked, then smiled wider.

"Okay. First time?" she asked.

Wei Ling's face burned under the mask.

Mei Xuan tilted her head.

"Not first time buying," she corrected calmly. "First time buying for his real size."

The assistant didn't react.

She only nodded, professional.

"Okay. Then we do soft first. No wire. Tenderness can happen," she said.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Tenderness.

Such a gentle word for something that made him feel like his body was rewriting itself.

The assistant gestured toward a section.

"Come. We can measure."

Wei Ling's legs felt unreal.

Mei Xuan stayed beside him.

The assistant led them to a fitting room.

Curtain closed.

Small space.

Bright mirror.

Wei Ling's hands shook.

Mei Xuan stood in front of him, arms crossed.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"This is weird," he whispered.

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes.

"Everything about you is weird," she said. Then, softer: "It's okay."

The assistant knocked lightly.

Mei Xuan answered yes.

The assistant stepped in briefly, tape measure in hand.

"We do quick," she said.

Wei Ling held his breath.

The tape went around, under, across--over his blouse.

Wei Ling flinched when the tape pressed near his chest.

The assistant noticed immediately.

"Tender," she said gently. "Okay, we go slower."

No judgment.

No awkward laughter.

Just care.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

The assistant wrote numbers down.

"Okay," she said. "You're still small. Bralette size S likely. Seamless, soft fabric. Very comfortable."

Mei Xuan nodded.

The assistant placed options on the bench--soft bralettes, light support.

"And," she added, smiling politely, "if you want, we can also look at panties and sleepwear."

Wei Ling's face went hot.

Mei Xuan's eyes gleamed.

"Yes," Mei Xuan said immediately.

Wei Ling choked. "Mei Xuan--"

Mei Xuan cut him off. "Clothes," she said flatly.

The assistant stepped out.

Curtain closed.

Wei Ling stared at the bras.

They looked harmless.

They also looked like a new chapter.

Mei Xuan picked up the softest one and held it out.

"Take off blouse," she said.

Wei Ling's stomach flipped.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed.

"You shy with me?" she asked.

Wei Ling's face burned.

"It makes it real," he admitted.

Mei Xuan went still.

Then her expression softened.

"Yes," she said quietly. "That's why we do."

Wei Ling's hands trembled as he unbuttoned his blouse.

He slipped it off slowly.

The fitting room air felt cold against his skin.

He hugged his arms around himself instinctively.

Mei Xuan's eyes flicked to his chest.

Wei Ling held his breath.

Mei Xuan didn't laugh.

Her gaze softened.

"Come," she said.

Then she guided the bralette over his arms.

Wei Ling's breath hitched.

Her fingers brushed his ribs.

The tenderness flared.

Wei Ling hissed softly.

Mei Xuan paused immediately.

"Too much?" she asked.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"It hurts a bit," he admitted. "But… okay."

Mei Xuan nodded.

She moved slower.

Adjusted the fabric gently.

No tugging.

No rushing.

When it settled, Wei Ling froze.

Light pressure.

Support.

Warmth.

And suddenly--without warning--his eyes stung.

He looked at himself in the mirror.

Not dramatic.

No fantasy.

Just… fit.

Like it belonged.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"It feels… right," he whispered.

Mei Xuan's mouth curved.

"Of course," she murmured.

Wei Ling blinked hard.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed. "Don't cry."

Wei Ling laughed shakily. "I'm not crying."

"Liar," Mei Xuan said.

Then she leaned in and kissed his temple--quick, hidden--before stepping back as if she hadn't just cracked his chest open.

"Okay," she said. "We buy two."

Wei Ling nodded.

Mei Xuan's gaze dropped--lower.

Wei Ling stiffened.

Mei Xuan's brows lifted.

"Your tuck very good," she said, tone half impressed, half amused.

Wei Ling's face went nuclear.

"Shut up," he hissed.

Mei Xuan smirked. "No, seriously. If I didn't know you, I would think you got nothing."

Wei Ling covered his face with his hands.

Mei Xuan laughed quietly.

"Okay, okay," she said. "Don't die."

She reached to the bench and picked up a pair of panties.

Wei Ling's head snapped up.

"Mei Xuan--"

Mei Xuan held his gaze.

"Comfort," she said. "And you need proper fit. Not those random cheap one you buy online."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

She was right.

Again.

Wei Ling tried a few.

Simple.

Seamless.

Nothing dramatic.

But the act itself--choosing something that sat against his body like it belonged--made his chest tighten in a different way.

Then Mei Xuan picked up a set of lace.

Matching.

Subtle, but undeniably… intimate.

Wei Ling stared.

Mei Xuan's eyes gleamed.

"What?" she asked.

Wei Ling's voice cracked. "That's… for what?"

Mei Xuan's mouth curved.

"For us," she said.

Wei Ling's breath caught.

Mei Xuan lifted another set.

Also lace.

Also matching.

"Try," she ordered.

Wei Ling's face burned.

Mei Xuan leaned in, voice low.

"You want me to buy and you never wear?" she whispered.

Wei Ling swallowed.

He tried.

The lace felt different.

Not just fabric.

A declaration.

Mei Xuan stepped behind him and adjusted the strap lightly, eyes narrowed in approval.

Then she vanished behind the curtain--into the next fitting room--because she had grabbed a matching set for herself too.

Wei Ling blinked.

Mei Xuan's voice came from the other side, casual:

"Don't move. I come."

Wei Ling's stomach flipped.

Mei Xuan returned a minute later, hair slightly messy, lace peeking beneath her robe-like cover-up, expression smug.

Wei Ling's breath caught.

Mei Xuan lifted an eyebrow.

"What? You never see me in lingerie before?"

Wei Ling's mouth went dry.

"No," he whispered.

Mei Xuan smirked.

"Then now you see," she said.

She stepped beside him in front of the mirror.

Two of them.

Side by side.

Matching lace.

Wei Ling's heart hammered.

Mei Xuan pulled out her phone.

Wei Ling froze.

"What you doing?"

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes.

"Photo," she said. "Couple pose."

Wei Ling's face went hot.

"Mei Xuan--"

Mei Xuan narrowed her eyes. "You want delete later, then delete. But I want one."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded.

Mei Xuan's smirk softened.

"Come," she said.

She wrapped an arm around his waist.

Wei Ling's body reacted immediately.

Mei Xuan laughed under her breath.

"Sensitive," she murmured.

Wei Ling glared.

Mei Xuan angled the camera.

They posed--simple at first.

Then Mei Xuan leaned in, cheek to his.

Wei Ling's breath hitched.

The shutter sound was small.

But the memory felt heavy.

Real.

They took another.

Mei Xuan pulled him closer.

Wei Ling's hands hovered, then settled at her waist.

The mirror showed them like a story someone else would write.

Two girls.

Two bodies.

Two kinds of beauty.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan lowered the phone and studied the photo.

"Nice," she said.

Wei Ling's chest loosened.

Then Mei Xuan picked up a nightgown from the bench--soft fabric, light, the kind that moved like water.

Wei Ling stared.

Mei Xuan smirked.

"Try," she said.

Wei Ling's voice came out weak. "You trying also?"

Mei Xuan's eyes gleamed.

"Of course," she said.

The fitting room became a private world--fabric sliding, shy laughter, Mei Xuan's blunt commentary, Wei Ling's embarrassed protest.

By the time they were dressed back in normal clothes, Wei Ling's cheeks hurt from smiling.

The assistant knocked again.

Mei Xuan opened the curtain slightly.

"We take this, this, and this," she said efficiently.

The assistant smiled.

"Good choices," she said.

Wei Ling held the shopping bag afterwards like it contained a fragile animal.

Two bralettes.

Panties.

Matching lace.

A nightgown.

Small fabric.

Huge meaning.

Outside, the mall noise pressed in.

Yet inside Wei Ling's chest, something was quiet.

A quiet that felt like afterglow.

Existential.

The feeling of taking a step and not falling.

Mei Xuan bumped his shoulder.

"Walk," she murmured.

Wei Ling walked.

Mei Xuan glanced at him.

"You okay?" she asked.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"I'm okay," he said.

Mei Xuan's lips curved.

"Good," she murmured.

Then she leaned closer and whispered,

"Tonight, wear the lace."

Wei Ling's breath caught.

His face heated.

Mei Xuan smirked like she had won something.

Wei Ling muttered, "You horny."

Mei Xuan laughed.

"Maybe," she said.

Then, quieter:

"I'm happy."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Me too, he wanted to say.

But happiness still felt like something he would have to pay for.

Mei Xuan seemed to read the silence.

She hooked her finger under his--small, hidden.

"Don't run," she murmured.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"I'm here," he whispered.

Mei Xuan hummed, satisfied.

That night, in Mei Xuan's room, Wei Ling stood in front of her mirror wearing the bralette again.

No blouse.

Just soft fabric and his skin.

His own hair fell over his shoulders.

No wig.

No borrowed weight.

Mei Xuan stood behind him.

Her hands rested lightly on his waist.

Wei Ling's breath hitched.

Mei Xuan's gaze met his in the mirror.

"You see?" she murmured. "Real."

Wei Ling swallowed.

He nodded.

Mei Xuan's fingers slid up slowly, stopping beneath the bralette's edge.

Wei Ling shivered.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed, amused.

"Sensitive," she whispered.

Wei Ling's face burned.

Mei Xuan leaned in, lips brushing his ear.

"Use your words," she murmured.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"Please," he whispered.

Mei Xuan's breath warmed his skin.

"Good boy," she murmured.

Wei Ling's knees went weak.

Mei Xuan turned him around.

Her gaze dropped to his chest.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

Mei Xuan's mouth curved.

"So this is new," she murmured.

Wei Ling nodded, embarrassed.

Mei Xuan stepped closer.

She pressed a kiss to the top edge of the bralette--just above where his skin was most tender.

Wei Ling's breath caught.

Another kiss.

Slower.

Then the soft scrape of teeth--careful, playful--followed by a gentle nibble that sent a sharp jolt straight through him.

Wei Ling made a sound he couldn't swallow.

Mei Xuan paused, eyes flicking up.

"Too much?" she asked, voice low.

Wei Ling shook his head quickly.

Mei Xuan's brows lifted.

"Words," she reminded.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"No," he breathed. "Not too much."

Mei Xuan's lips curved.

"Good," she murmured.

She kissed him again--lower this time, more deliberate--then tugged the bralette's fabric just enough to make him feel the sensitivity spike.

Wei Ling's eyes fluttered.

A new kind of pleasure rolled through him--unexpected, overwhelming.

He had explored his body in one direction for so long that he hadn't realized there were other doors.

This one--this tenderness--made his stomach flip, made his breath break, made his whole body feel too awake.

Mei Xuan watched him like she was pleased by how honest his reactions were.

"You didn't know," she murmured.

Wei Ling shook his head.

Mei Xuan leaned in, voice warm against his skin.

"Then learn," she whispered.

She guided the night with the same careful authority as always--checking him, teasing him, rewarding him when he used his words, holding him steady when the sensitivity overwhelmed him.

Wei Ling melted.

Not into shame.

Into trust.

And when the heat finally softened into trembling quiet, Mei Xuan didn't let him disappear into it alone.

She pulled him into her arms.

She held him.

She pressed a kiss to his hair.

Afterglow wrapped around them like warm water.

Wei Ling lay with his cheek against her chest, listening to her heartbeat.

Mei Xuan's fingers combed through his real hair--longer now, softer.

Wei Ling swallowed.

"Mei Xuan," he whispered.

Mei Xuan hummed.

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

"I'm scared," he admitted.

Mei Xuan's hand stilled.

"Of what?"

Wei Ling stared at the ceiling.

"Of being happy," he whispered.

Mei Xuan didn't laugh.

She exhaled softly.

"Then be scared," she said. "But don't run."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded.

Mei Xuan's fingers tightened around his.

"You bought bra for your real body already," she murmured. "You think you can pretend nothing changing?"

Wei Ling laughed weakly.

Mei Xuan's voice softened.

"It's okay," she said. "Change is not punishment."

Wei Ling's eyes stung.

Mei Xuan sighed. "Don't cry."

Wei Ling laughed shakily.

Mei Xuan rolled her eyes.

Then she kissed his forehead.

A simple kiss.

A vow.

Wei Ling closed his eyes.

For the first time, the tenderness in his chest didn't feel like pain.

It felt like proof.

And proof, in the arms of someone who had chosen him, felt a lot like hope.
