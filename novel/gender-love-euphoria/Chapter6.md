# Chapter 6 -- The First Private Door

The trouble with locked doors was that they kept other people out.

They also kept *you* in.

Wei Ling's single room was quiet at night in a way the kampung had never been. No wall to knock on. No mother's footsteps in the hallway. No crickets loud enough to disguise your thoughts.

Just a corridor that softened after curfew, the occasional laugh fading down the stairwell, and the hum of the hostel's air-conditioning breathing through vents like a patient animal.

Wei Ling sat at his desk with his laptop open and his phone face-down.

He had been trying to study.

He had been trying to act like a normal first-year student who was simply tired from orientation.

But the moment he closed his eyes, Mei Xuan's face appeared.

Not even romantic.

Just present.

Her eyes meeting his across the hall.

Her voice saying, *Nice to meet you.*

As if they were strangers.

As if their childhood had been a dream he'd made up.

He exhaled slowly, palms pressed to the edge of the desk.

Under the wig and makeup, he was still Chen Wei.

Under Wei Ling, he was still a boy who had grown up in a kampung and learned early that life had rules.

Boys stood like this.

Boys spoke like that.

Boys wanted girls.

Girls wanted boys.

And if you didn't fit, you learned to pretend.

Wei Ling had pretended his whole life.

So why did pretending *now* feel like breathing?

That was the part he couldn't explain.

It wasn't only the plan.

He kept telling himself it was.

But when he was alone--when there was nobody to convince--the truth pressed closer.

Something in him had been aching long before Mei Xuan ever said she liked girls.

He just hadn't known what to call it.

The ache lived in quiet moments:

When he watched girls tie their hair up and felt something twist in his chest.

When aunties said, *so handsome,* and it didn't land like praise--it landed like a costume.

When he saw a reflection of himself in a shop window and felt detached, as if the person walking was a version of him the world demanded.

Back then, he had swallowed the ache the way he swallowed everything.

He had turned it into jokes.

Into noise.

Into being the loud boy who didn't think too much.

But now, in this room, the ache had nowhere to hide.

It sharpened.

It spread.

It made his skin feel too tight.

He reached for his phone.

It was stupid--he told himself it was stupid--how quickly his thumb opened the same apps he had been doom-scrolling for weeks.

Makeup creators.

Campus vlogs.

Queer Malaysian accounts that spoke carefully in code.

Tonight, the algorithm offered him something else.

A short video.

No face.

Just hands and a soft voice.

A person talking about "discovering your body without shame," about "pleasure being information," about "how wanting softness doesn't make you weak."

Wei Ling watched with his breath held.

The person didn't say anything explicit.

They didn't have to.

Their words slipped into Wei Ling's ribs like a key.

*Sometimes you don't realize you've been holding your breath your whole life until you finally exhale,* the voice said.

Wei Ling stared at the screen.

His throat tightened.

He had been holding his breath.

Not just in the hallway.

Not just when Mei Xuan looked at him.

His whole life.

He scrolled.

Another clip.

This one was more practical.

A person talking--matter-of-fact, almost clinical--about how different people experienced pleasure differently, how there wasn't one "correct" way to be a man or a woman, how the body was not an enemy.

Wei Ling's stomach tightened.

He felt a pulse deep inside his body--an itch he didn't want to admit existed.

It wasn't just arousal.

It was curiosity.

A hunger to know what his body could feel if he stopped treating it like something to control.

He turned the phone off abruptly.

The room went quiet again.

Wei Ling stared at the dark screen.

He could ignore it.

He could bury the ache like he always had.

He could tell himself he only needed to perfect the disguise, to talk to Mei Xuan again, to keep the plan alive.

But the ache was already awake.

And once something woke up inside you, it was hard to force it back to sleep.

The next afternoon, after a string of orientation briefings that left his brain buzzing, Wei Ling found himself walking off-campus without fully deciding to.

He told Aina he needed to buy toiletries.

Which was true.

It was also not the whole truth.

The city outside campus was loud in the daylight--students pouring into cafés, motorbikes weaving between cars, the smell of fried chicken and coffee mixing in the hot air.

Wei Ling kept his mask on.

He kept his head down.

He walked with the careful pace of someone who didn't want to be remembered.

He passed a pharmacy.

A clothing store.

A bookstore.

Then he saw it.

A small shop tucked between a nail salon and a phone accessory stall.

The signage was subtle.

No neon.

No vulgar jokes.

Just a neat logo and a phrase that could have been about skincare if you didn't know better.

Wei Ling's pulse jumped.

He stopped walking.

He stared at the storefront like it was a dare.

His reflection in the glass looked like Wei Ling--long hair, soft makeup, skirt brushing his calves.

But behind that reflection was Chen Wei's fear.

*If I go in… what does that make me?*

The question was sharp.

The answer was softer.

*Human.*

He stepped forward.

The bell above the door chimed.

Inside, the lighting was warm, not harsh.

The shelves were organized.

It didn't feel sleazy.

It felt… strangely safe.

A woman behind the counter looked up.

She was in her late twenties or early thirties, hair tied up, expression neutral in the way retail workers perfected.

"Hi," she said. "Can I help?"

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded too quickly.

"I… I'm just looking," he said.

His voice came out soft.

The woman didn't flinch.

She didn't look him up and down.

She only smiled politely.

"Okay. Take your time. If you need recommendations, just ask."

Wei Ling walked slowly down the aisle.

His eyes didn't know where to land.

Packaging. Words. Shapes.

Some items were obviously meant for couples.

Some were clearly for solo use.

There were sections labeled with neutral language--"Beginners," "Care & Hygiene," "Lubricants," "Accessories."

Wei Ling's chest felt tight.

He wasn't sure what he was looking for.

Not truly.

He only knew he had an itch inside him he couldn't scratch with thought.

He picked up one item, then put it down.

Picked up another.

Put it down.

He felt ridiculous.

Like a teenager stealing glances at a forbidden magazine.

Then he remembered the voice in the video.

*Pleasure is information.*

Information didn't have to be shame.

He walked back toward the counter, hands empty, and stopped two steps away like he was afraid the woman could smell his fear.

"Um," he said.

The woman looked up again, patient.

"Yes?"

Wei Ling swallowed.

"I… I don't know what to get," he admitted.

The confession made his face heat under the mask.

The woman's expression didn't change.

"Okay," she said simply. "First time?"

Wei Ling nodded.

The woman came out from behind the counter and stood beside the shelf, keeping a respectful distance.

"Do you have any preference? Like… do you want something more external, more internal, or just exploring?"

Wei Ling's heart hammered.

He stared at the shelf like it had answers.

"I… exploring," he said.

The woman nodded, like this was the most normal sentence in the world.

"Then we start safe," she said. "Beginner-friendly. Body-safe materials. And you'll need lubricant. Always."

Wei Ling's ears burned.

The woman pointed to a shelf.

"Here. Water-based is versatile. Silicone-based lasts longer but not compatible with some materials. If you don't know, water-based is safest."

Wei Ling nodded, absorbing the information like a student.

She continued, calm and practical.

"Also cleaning. You should have a proper cleanser. Not just soap. And go slow. No pressure to do anything you don't want."

No pressure.

The phrase loosened something in Wei Ling's chest.

He wasn't used to being told that.

The woman picked up a small box and showed him the label without forcing it into his hands.

"Beginner size. Smooth. This is for people who want internal stimulation. Some people like it, some people don't. Bodies differ."

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded again.

The woman studied him--not in a judging way, but in a careful, customer-service way.

"Do you want something quieter? Something discreet?" she asked.

Wei Ling's eyes flicked toward the door.

"Yes," he said quickly.

The woman smiled slightly.

"Then this." She pointed to packaging that looked almost like a gadget.

"And if you're nervous, start with something smaller. The goal is comfort, not proving anything."

Wei Ling exhaled shakily.

He didn't know why her words felt like kindness.

Maybe because he expected shame.

And she gave him professionalism instead.

He picked out what he could manage without his hands trembling too visibly: a beginner-friendly item, a bottle of lubricant, and cleanser.

At the counter, the woman scanned them.

Her eyes flicked once to the items.

Then back to him.

No judgment.

Only a small, amused softness.

"Good choices," she said. "And… one more thing."

Wei Ling's stomach dropped.

The woman reached under the counter and placed a small packet beside his purchase.

"Relaxation matters. If you tense, it'll feel bad. Some people also prefer other options, but you picked this path--so just be gentle with yourself, okay?"

Wei Ling's throat tightened.

He nodded.

"Okay," he whispered.

The woman handed him the bag.

"Take care, kak," she said casually.

*Kak.*

Wei Ling's pulse jumped again.

He walked out into the sunlight with the bag held tightly, as if squeezing it could keep the world from seeing through him.

He walked fast.

Not because he was ashamed.

Because his body felt too awake.

Back in his room, Wei Ling locked the door.

The click sounded louder than usual.

He placed the bag on the bed.

He stared at it for a long time.

The items inside were small.

Ordinary.

And yet they felt like a threshold.

If he opened the bag, he would be admitting something:

That this wasn't just about Mei Xuan.

That there was a part of him hungry to understand his own body.

To understand why presenting as Wei Ling made him feel alive.

To understand why the idea of surrendering--of being softened--didn't feel like humiliation.

It felt like relief.

He set up his room like he was preparing for a ritual.

He tidied the desk.

He placed a towel on the bed.

He turned the lights lower.

Not to be dramatic.

Because harsh light made him feel exposed.

He showered.

Slowly.

He washed his hair and conditioned it.

He shaved again until his skin was smooth.

He stood under the water with his eyes closed and tried to listen to his own breathing.

When he stepped out, he wrapped himself in a towel and stared at his reflection in the mirror.

For a second, he considered putting on the wig and makeup.

To do this as Wei Ling.

Then he realized that would be another performance.

Tonight wasn't about being seen.

Tonight was about being honest.

He put on a soft, oversized T-shirt.

No skirt.

No disguise.

Just him.

Then he sat on the bed and opened the bag.

He read the instructions.

Twice.

His hands shook slightly.

He felt ridiculous.

He felt terrified.

He felt curious.

His body hummed like it was waiting.

He moved carefully, following what the clerk had said--slow, patient, gentle.

He focused on comfort.

On breath.

On not forcing anything.

There was no instant magic.

No sudden transformation.

Just a gradual awareness of sensation--of how the body could be coaxed instead of commanded.

He kept breathing.

He let himself feel.

The first time his body reacted--when a wave of warmth climbed up his spine--Wei Ling froze.

Shock.

Then another wave came, deeper.

His breath hitched.

He pressed his face into his pillow, not because he was ashamed, but because the sensation was too intense to look at.

He wasn't used to his body giving him pleasure without permission.

He wasn't used to softness.

He wasn't used to being the one receiving.

His hands trembled.

His thighs tensed.

He forced himself to slow down again, to listen, to stay gentle.

The room felt hot.

The air felt thick.

His heartbeat filled his ears.

The sensations built gradually--not like the sharp, familiar kind of release he knew from teenage years, quick and guilty.

This was different.

This was layered.

Like his body was opening door after door.

He wasn't sure when it happened--only that at some point, the warmth gathered in him and became something unstoppable.

A swell.

A pull.

A crest.

Wei Ling's breath broke.

His body shook.

A quiet, involuntary sound escaped him--half gasp, half sob--before he could swallow it.

Then the wave crashed through him.

Not violent.

Not rough.

Just overwhelming.

He gripped the pillow like it could keep him grounded while his body lit up from the inside.

When it finally eased, Wei Ling lay still, chest rising and falling too quickly.

The room felt unreal.

His skin felt sensitive.

His limbs felt heavy.

His mind--usually loud--was suddenly blank.

He stared at the ceiling, eyes wide.

For a long moment, he couldn't move.

Not because he was hurt.

Because he felt… stunned.

As if his body had just spoken a truth his brain had refused to hear.

He swallowed.

Slowly, he cleaned up, careful and practical, following the instructions again like a student who didn't want to fail.

Then he returned to the bed.

He lay down on his back.

The air-conditioning hummed.

Somewhere down the corridor, someone laughed.

Wei Ling stared at the ceiling and felt the afterglow settle into him like warm water.

It wasn't just physical.

It was emotional.

He felt… softer.

Not weak.

Soft the way rain softened the heat.

Soft the way candlelight softened the dark.

His throat tightened unexpectedly.

Tears rose.

Not dramatic.

Just sudden.

Like his body had opened a door and behind it was grief.

Grief for all the years he had treated himself like a problem.

Grief for all the times he had forced himself into shapes that didn't fit.

Grief for the boy who didn't know there were other ways to exist.

He turned his head into the pillow and let the tears come quietly.

No sobbing.

No noise.

Just a steady release.

When the tears slowed, Wei Ling lay there breathing.

His phone buzzed.

A notification.

He reached for it with heavy fingers.

It was the hostel group chat.

Aina had posted:

*Tomorrow club fair! Wei Ling you come ah. Don't disappear.*

Wei Ling stared at the message.

For some reason, the word *disappear* hit him.

He had disappeared once already--from Mei Xuan, from the kampung, from himself.

He had thought disappearing would save him.

But the truth was, disappearing had only made him lonely.

He typed slowly:

*Okay. I come.*

He sent it.

Then he put the phone down.

His body still felt warm.

His mind still felt strangely quiet.

In that quiet, he admitted something he had been avoiding.

The need he felt wasn't only about desire.

It was about recognition.

When the cashier called him *kak*… when strangers looked at him and saw Wei Ling… when his own body responded to softness…

it all pointed to the same uncomfortable truth:

He had been starving for permission.

Permission to feel.

Permission to be.

He stared at the ceiling.

Mei Xuan's face drifted into his mind again.

Not as a prize.

Not as a target.

As a person.

A person whose existence had sparked this entire spiral.

Wei Ling's chest tightened.

He didn't know what came next.

He didn't know whether he was still running a plan, or whether the plan had already slipped out of his hands.

All he knew was that he had opened a door.

And behind it was a version of himself that felt terrifyingly real.

He closed his eyes.

The afterglow held him like a blanket.

And for the first time since he left the kampung, Wei Ling fell asleep without feeling like he was choking on his own heart.
