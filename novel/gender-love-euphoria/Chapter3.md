# Chapter 3 -- The Clean Cut

After the rain-shelter day, the world did not explode.

No dramatic fallout.

No screaming.

No slammed doors.

Just a quiet shift in gravity.

Chen Wei went to school as usual.

He still sat through lectures that smelled faintly of whiteboard marker and tired bodies. He still copied notes, still pretended he was listening when teachers lectured them about the future like the future was a clean, straight road.

Mei Xuan still sat two rows away in the same classroom.

She still scribbled her neat handwriting into her notebook. She still frowned at questions like they personally offended her. She still glanced at him sometimes, quick and subtle.

Nothing changed.

Except everything.

He noticed it in the smallest things first.

The way his hand hesitated before reaching for her shoulder in a crowded corridor.

The way he stopped making certain jokes, afraid they would sound like longing.

The way he suddenly became aware of the distance between their bodies when they stood beside each other--distance that had never mattered before.

There was a new awareness between them.

A knowledge that lived under their banter like a second language.

And Chen Wei hated it.

Not because Mei Xuan liked girls.

He told himself--over and over--that he wasn't angry at her.

He couldn't be.

She hadn't chosen it to hurt him.

She hadn't announced it like a weapon.

It had slipped out of her world through careless mouths, and he had been unfortunate enough to be standing there.

The thing he hated was how his own feelings suddenly felt… embarrassing.

Like a childish mistake.

Like he had misread an entire lifetime.

He hated that every memory--every argument, every laughter, every night market, every candlelit silence--now came with a question mark.

Did she ever see him that way?

Had she ever *almost*?

Or had he always been a brother-shaped placeholder in her life, convenient and familiar and safe?

That question crawled under his skin.

He wanted to scratch it out.

Mei Xuan noticed.

Of course she did.

She had always been the one who noticed first.

The first week after the rain, she didn't say anything.

She treated him the same. She still texted him reminders about assignments, still scolded him when he forgot to bring his calculator, still called him stupid when he smiled too widely.

Chen Wei answered.

He forced himself to.

He replied with the right amount of teasing.

He laughed at the right times.

He maintained the shape of their friendship like someone holding up a collapsing tent with his bare hands.

But the effort exhausted him.

At night, alone in his room, he stared at the drawer where he'd hidden the bracelet.

He never opened it.

He couldn't.

The thought of that crescent charm felt like shame.

Like evidence.

Like a confession he had swallowed so hard it was still lodged in his throat.

On the ninth day, Mei Xuan caught him leaving school early.

He had slipped out during a break, telling himself he needed to go home and sleep, that he had a headache, that his body was just tired.

He almost made it to the gate.

Then he heard her voice.

"Chen Wei."

Not sharp.

Not teasing.

Just his name--plain and steady.

He froze like a child caught stealing.

He turned.

Mei Xuan stood a few steps behind him, her bag hanging from one shoulder, her expression unreadable.

"What?" he asked, too quickly.

Mei Xuan's eyes narrowed.

"You avoiding me?"

The question landed clean.

No drama.

No accusation.

Just an observation.

Chen Wei felt heat rise up his neck.

"What nonsense," he said, forcing a laugh. "Why I avoid you? You think you celebrity ah?"

Mei Xuan didn't laugh.

She stared at him.

Chen Wei had always been good at surviving her stare by turning it into a joke.

This time, he couldn't.

Mei Xuan stepped closer.

Her voice dropped. "Since that day… you weird."

Chen Wei swallowed.

He tried to shrug. "I'm always weird."

Mei Xuan's jaw tightened.

"Don't play," she said.

The words--*don't play*--hit him harder than he expected.

Because they weren't just about his jokes.

They were about him.

About the way he kept pretending everything was normal.

Chen Wei's chest tightened.

"I'm just tired," he said.

Mei Xuan's eyes softened for half a second, like she wanted to believe him.

Then suspicion returned.

"Tired because study?" she asked.

Chen Wei nodded too fast. "Ya."

Mei Xuan leaned back slightly, studying him the way she always studied problems.

Then she said, quietly, "That day… you wanted to tell me something."

Chen Wei's heart stopped.

He forced a scoff. "Already tell you. Your face got water."

Mei Xuan's lips pressed together.

She didn't smile.

She didn't punch his arm.

She only said, "If you got something, just say."

Chen Wei stared at her.

He felt a wave of something hot and bitter rise in him.

He wanted to say it.

He wanted to throw the truth at her like a stone and watch what happened.

But he also wanted to keep her.

Even if he couldn't have her.

Even if it meant swallowing himself.

He exhaled.

"There's nothing," he said.

Mei Xuan's face tightened.

"Okay," she said.

But the way she said it sounded like defeat.

Chen Wei felt guilty instantly.

He opened his mouth.

Mei Xuan stepped back.

"If you don't want to talk, then don't," she said.

Her voice was sharper now, anger rising to cover hurt.

Chen Wei flinched.

Mei Xuan turned away, walking back toward the school building without looking at him again.

Chen Wei stood there watching her go, feeling like he'd just dropped something precious and couldn't pick it up.

He left anyway.

The months that followed were filled with exams.

Everything became numbers, schedules, deadlines.

The adults around them grew louder, as if volume could force success.

"Study harder."

"Don't waste time."

"Think about your future."

Chen Wei thought about his future constantly.

Not the one adults meant.

His future was Mei Xuan-shaped.

And now that shape was both the comfort and the poison.

Mei Xuan, meanwhile, moved with a new kind of distance.

She still talked to him.

But she stopped waiting for him.

If he was late, she didn't scold him anymore.

If he didn't reply quickly, she didn't spam him with angry stickers.

If he skipped lunch, she didn't show up at his table with an extra drink.

That scared him more than anger.

Because anger meant she still cared.

Distance meant she was learning how to live without him.

Chen Wei told himself he deserved it.

He had started the distance.

He couldn't complain when she followed.

Still, the fear sat in his chest like a stone.

Some days, he caught himself watching her laugh with her friends--the same friends who had outed her so casually, who had nearly turned her into a joke.

But Mei Xuan had changed too.

She had become more careful.

More selective.

Her laughter with them was real, but guarded, like she had learned the cost of being seen.

Once, Chen Wei overheard a teacher calling Mei Xuan aside after class.

The teacher's voice was gentle but firm.

"You know in Malaysia… some things, better keep private. For your own safety."

Mei Xuan's voice came flat.

"I know."

Chen Wei stood in the corridor, frozen.

Something bitter rose in him.

Not jealousy.

Not exactly.

Anger at a world that made Mei Xuan's truth something she had to hide.

Anger at himself for wanting her in a way that suddenly felt selfish.

He walked away before he could hear more.

After their final exam, the school held a small farewell.

Not like rich schools with fancy graduation ceremonies.

Just a hall with plastic chairs and too-bright fluorescent lights, a slideshow of awkward class photos, and teachers giving speeches about "remembering your roots."

Everyone was loud.

Relief made people careless.

Girls hugged each other and cried dramatically.

Boys slapped each other's backs like soldiers.

Someone played music too loudly from a phone speaker.

Chen Wei stood near the back of the hall, hands in pockets, watching.

Mei Xuan was in the middle of it all, surrounded by friends.

She laughed when someone said something stupid.

She rolled her eyes when a teacher teased her about being "bossy."

Her hair was longer now.

Her face looked older.

Not by much.

Just enough to remind Chen Wei that time was moving whether he liked it or not.

He had brought the bracelet.

He didn't know why.

Maybe a part of him still wanted to give it to her--without confession, without expectations, just a final offering of something he had once hoped for.

It sat in his pocket like a secret.

When the hall cleared out and people spilled into the evening air, Chen Wei finally found a moment.

Mei Xuan stood alone near the side gate, checking her phone.

The sky above the kampung was a bruised purple, the sun sinking behind trees.

Chen Wei approached.

Mei Xuan looked up.

For a second, they simply stared at each other.

There was no bickering.

No easy banter.

Just the quiet weight of years.

"You going home?" Chen Wei asked.

Mei Xuan nodded. "Ya."

Chen Wei swallowed.

His fingers curled around the bracelet in his pocket.

He imagined handing it to her.

Mei Xuan's eyes flicked to his pocket, like she could sense movement.

"Got something?" she asked.

Chen Wei's heart kicked.

He forced his hand to relax.

He shook his head.

"No."

Mei Xuan's gaze lingered, as if she didn't believe him.

Then she sighed.

"Okay."

Chen Wei hated how often "okay" had become between them.

Mei Xuan shifted her bag higher on her shoulder.

"So… university," she said.

Chen Wei nodded.

Mei Xuan hesitated, then asked, carefully, "You apply where?"

The question sounded casual.

But Chen Wei heard the underlying thing.

*Are we going the same direction?*

*Are you leaving me?*

Chen Wei's tongue felt thick.

He could tell her.

He could say, "I'm applying here, where you're applying."

He could say, "I want to stay close."

But the last few months had taught him something ugly.

Closeness hurt.

Closeness kept hope alive.

Hope was a knife.

Chen Wei swallowed.

"I haven't decide," he lied.

Mei Xuan's brows drew together.

"You so last minute," she said.

Chen Wei shrugged. "Relax la."

Mei Xuan stared at him like she wanted to say more.

Then she said, quietly, "If you decide… tell me."

Chen Wei felt his throat tighten.

He nodded.

"Okay."

Mei Xuan's lips pressed together.

For a second, she looked like she wanted to hit him.

Then she didn't.

She just turned away.

"Bye," she said.

Chen Wei watched her walk down the road.

He stood there until she disappeared behind a line of houses.

Only then did he take out the bracelet.

The crescent charm glinted faintly in the fading light.

Chen Wei stared at it.

Then he closed his fist around it so hard it hurt.

He went home and shoved it back into the drawer.

He didn't know it then.

But that was the last time he would see Mei Xuan as "normal."

Their "tertiary education" period--pre-university--began like a new chapter nobody had asked for.

Mei Xuan went to a college program in town, commuting by bus.

Chen Wei enrolled in a different pre-U track, also local, also busy, also filled with people who talked about grades like it was religion.

They were no longer forced into the same classroom.

No longer forced into the same daily routine.

Their friendship--once automatic--became something that required effort.

Chen Wei didn't have effort.

Not for this.

The first few weeks, Mei Xuan still texted.

Simple things.

*You eat already?*

*Your math okay?*

*This lecturer damn annoying.*

Chen Wei replied late.

One-word replies.

*Ya.*

*Okay.*

*Lol.*

Mei Xuan noticed immediately.

Her texts changed.

They became fewer.

Then sharper.

*Why you so cold?*

Chen Wei stared at that message for a long time.

His thumbs hovered.

He could tell her the truth.

He could say, *Because I like you, and it hurts.*

But saying it would mean forcing her to hold his pain.

And he couldn't do that.

So he typed:

*Busy.*

Mei Xuan replied:

*Busy or avoiding?*

Chen Wei didn't answer.

That silence--small, cowardly--was the beginning of the cut.

The cut deepened in tiny increments.

He stopped replying quickly.

He stopped picking up calls.

He stopped crossing the wall.

Sometimes, at night, he would hear a knock on the wall.

A familiar rhythm.

*Tok tok tok.*

Chen Wei would freeze in his room, heart slamming.

He wouldn't move.

He would wait until the knocking stopped.

Then he would lie in the dark feeling like the worst version of himself.

Mei Xuan knocked less and less.

Until she stopped.

The kampung noticed.

Because kampung people always did.

The aunties at the wet market asked Chen Wei's mother, "Eh, your son and Mei Xuan fight ah? Why never see together already?"

Chen Wei's mother shrugged, pretending it didn't matter. "Teenagers la. Mood."

But at home, she watched Chen Wei more closely.

One evening, while chopping garlic, she said casually, "You and Mei Xuan not friends anymore?"

Chen Wei felt his throat tighten.

He forced a laugh. "Friends la. Just busy."

His mother hummed.

She didn't push.

But the way she glanced at him--quiet, knowing--made Chen Wei's skin prickle.

Even his father, who rarely commented on emotions, asked once, "You okay?"

Chen Wei nodded.

He wasn't.

He had started waking up with a heaviness in his chest.

He had started losing interest in things.

He had started feeling like the world was too loud.

Sometimes, he caught himself staring at the mirror and thinking:

If I were different…

Would she have loved me?

He hated himself for thinking it.

He hated that the question existed at all.

The cut became complete the day he saw her with someone.

It wasn't dramatic.

Not movie-like.

Just a glimpse.

He was at a small café near town after classes, waiting for a takeaway kopi because his brain felt like it was drowning in numbers.

Through the glass window, he saw Mei Xuan across the street.

She was walking with another girl.

The girl was tall, with short hair and a loose button-up shirt.

They walked close.

Not holding hands.

Not openly.

But close enough that their shoulders brushed.

Mei Xuan laughed at something the girl said.

And the way Mei Xuan looked at her--soft, open--was something Chen Wei had not seen directed at anyone else.

It wasn't about romance, not necessarily.

It was about comfort.

About being seen.

Chen Wei's stomach turned.

He told himself, *Don't be stupid.*

He told himself, *She deserves happiness.*

He told himself, *You have no right.*

But jealousy was not logical.

It rose hot and immediate.

He wanted to run outside and interrupt.

He wanted to drag Mei Xuan away and demand, *Is this what you want?*

He wanted to scream at the sky.

Instead, he stood in the café, frozen, watching.

Mei Xuan and the girl crossed the road.

For a brief moment, Mei Xuan's eyes flicked toward the café.

Toward him.

Chen Wei's breath caught.

He wasn't sure if she saw him.

If she did, she didn't stop.

She kept walking.

Chen Wei watched until they disappeared into the crowd.

Then he paid for his kopi and walked home feeling hollow.

That night, he made the decision he had been drifting toward.

If he stayed close to her, he would rot.

If he stayed her "best friend," he would become bitter.

And bitterness would poison the only thing he still valued: her happiness.

So he cut.

Clean.

He changed his number.

He deactivated social media.

He told his parents he wanted a fresh start.

He told himself he was doing the right thing.

Mei Xuan tried to reach him.

At first, she texted.

The messages didn't go through.

Then she called.

The number was no longer his.

Then she knocked on the wall.

Chen Wei didn't answer.

Finally, she came to his front gate one afternoon.

He saw her through the window.

Her hair was tied back, her face tense.

She waited.

Chen Wei's mother opened the door.

Chen Wei stood in the hallway, heart pounding, listening.

"Chen Wei not home," his mother lied.

Mei Xuan's voice came strained. "Auntie… can you tell him to call me?"

His mother paused.

"Okay," she said.

Chen Wei pressed his forehead against the wall.

He felt sick.

He wanted to run out.

He wanted to apologize.

But he didn't.

He stayed hidden.

Mei Xuan left.

And that was it.

The duo ended.

Not with a fight.

Not with closure.

Just with absence.

Chen Wei told himself he would move on.

He applied to universities with a detached efficiency.

He asked around discreetly about where Mei Xuan was applying.

Not because he wanted to follow.

Because he wanted to avoid.

But the knowledge hit him like gravity.

Mei Xuan had chosen a university far from the kampung.

A place with a bigger city energy.

A place where people could disappear into crowds.

A place where she could be herself more easily.

Chen Wei stared at the university's name on his screen.

He imagined Mei Xuan there.

New friends.

New routines.

New love.

A life without him.

The thought made him dizzy.

He told himself, *This is good. She will be fine.*

But then a darker thought surfaced.

*What if the only way to stay close is to stop being what she can't want?*

He hated himself for thinking it.

He tried to bury it.

It returned.

Again and again.

As if his mind had found a desperate loophole.

One night, after hours of staring at university application forms, Chen Wei opened a search bar and typed words he didn't understand yet.

"how to pass as a girl."

His chest tightened.

He stared at the screen, horrified.

Then, slowly, he clicked.

The internet opened doors that kampung life had never offered.

Tutorials.

Forums.

Videos.

People talking openly about gender, about presentation, about desire and identity.

At first, Chen Wei told himself it was just research.

A plan.

A strategy.

He told himself he wasn't like them.

He wasn't questioning himself.

He wasn't *that.*

He was just… trying to become what Mei Xuan liked.

It sounded ridiculous even in his head.

But desperation made ridiculous things feel logical.

He stared at images of makeup techniques.

He read about wigs.

He learned about tucking.

He learned about voice training.

His fingers trembled as he scrolled.

Something in him--something quiet and secret--thrummed beneath the fear.

Curiosity.

Not sexual.

Not yet.

Just a strange, forbidden fascination.

He tried to ignore it.

But the more he read, the more he felt a pull.

Like he was staring at a door that had always existed in his house, hidden behind furniture, and now someone had moved the furniture away.

He thought about the question again.

*If I were different… would she love me?*

The question shifted.

It became more dangerous.

*If I become different… will I love myself?*

That thought scared him so much he slammed his laptop shut.

He sat in the dark, breathing hard.

The kampung outside was quiet.

Crickets.

A distant dog barking.

A motorcycle passing.

The normal sounds of a life that had always been stable.

Inside him, something was cracking.

The next day, Chen Wei made a decision that would change everything.

He applied to the same university as Mei Xuan.

Not under his name.

Not as himself.

At least--not as the "him" the kampung knew.

He rented a small room near the campus months before intake.

He told his parents it was for convenience.

His mother frowned but agreed.

His father nodded, practical.

Nobody asked too many questions.

Chen Wei moved into the rented room with a single suitcase.

The room smelled like dust and old paint.

The ceiling fan clicked when it turned.

The windows faced another building, close enough that he could see a stranger's laundry hanging.

He stood in the middle of the room and felt a wave of loneliness.

No wall between houses.

No familiar road.

No Mei Xuan.

He placed his suitcase on the floor and opened it.

Inside were clothes.

Not his usual clothes.

A simple dress.

A blouse.

A skirt.

Cheap, bought online, delivered in plain packaging.

His hands shook as he lifted the fabric.

It felt soft.

It felt too light.

It felt like something that did not belong to him.

He stared at it.

Then he thought of Mei Xuan.

He thought of her laughter.

He thought of the way her eyes had looked at that other girl.

He thought of the door closing.

He swallowed.

"Just for the plan," he whispered to himself.

He said it like a spell.

Like repeating it could keep him safe.

He opened his phone and typed a new name into his notes.

**Wei Ling.**

A name that felt like borrowed skin.

A name that sounded soft on the tongue.

A name that could walk beside Mei Xuan without being rejected at the starting line.

Chen Wei stared at the name until his eyes blurred.

He didn't understand yet that this was not just a plan.

Plans had exits.

Plans ended.

This…

This felt like stepping onto a road that would not let him turn back.

He stood in the rented room, dress in hand, heart pounding.

Outside, the city noise hummed.

Inside, Chen Wei whispered again, tighter this time:

"Just for the plan."

Then, with the second kind of courage--heavy, trembling, expensive--

he went to the small bathroom, locked the door, and began.
