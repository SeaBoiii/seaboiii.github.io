## *The Silk of Fate*  
**Chapter 38 – The Vote That Should Not Exist**

The Empress Dowager received her privately.

No attendants.

No guards.

Just a single candle lit between them, and a long stretch of silence before either spoke.

“You are here to ask,” the Dowager said, not unkindly.

“I am,” Lianhua replied.

“For a delay?”

“For a *vote*.”

---

That word hung in the air like smoke.

Not forbidden.

But not often spoken aloud.

---

Lianhua didn’t beg.  
Didn’t plead.

She placed her case like a scholar building an argument:  
Historical precedent. Political benefit. Diplomatic stability.

She reminded the Dowager of her Buddhist sympathies.  
Of her own influence among younger scholars.  
Of the unrest in certain provinces that *might worsen* if the court silenced a popular voice.

But more than that—she invoked something deeper.

> “This is not only about whom I marry,” she said.  
> “It’s about whether a woman may choose her place in the shape of history.”

---

The Empress Dowager listened.

Then poured them both tea.

She said only:

> “You will need five signatures. No fewer.”

> “And not just philosophers. You’ll need generals. Merchants. Men who have never once considered saying ‘yes’ to a woman like you.”

> “Can you do it?”

---

Lianhua bowed her head.

> “I already have three.”

---

The next day, she met with **Minister Wei**, a former poet turned bureaucrat with a soft spot for Lianhua’s lectures and a widow for a daughter.

He signed after reading one page.

---

She met with **General Pan**, whose troops had once been healed in a hospital funded quietly by Lianhua’s intervention. He did not smile when he signed.

But he did nod.

---

The third was **Lady Shen**, a logistics administrator whose sister had married across religious lines—and nearly lost everything for it. Lianhua did not need to convince her.

She signed with a trembling but firm hand.

---

Two more remained.

And time was thin.

---

That evening, Lianhua sent a scroll with no name attached. No ink visible to the naked eye.

But soaked in plum blossom tea—when heated, a message would appear.

It read:

> *Five voices will let me breathe a little longer.*  
> *But if you wish for more than delay—prepare your people. The hour will come.*
