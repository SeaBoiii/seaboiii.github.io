## **Chapter 45 – Waiting for the Silk to Hold** *(Idran’s POV)*

He received the message while walking the coastline with his advisors.

One of his guards handed him a scroll, folded among reports.

At the bottom, Lianhua’s hidden script:

> *Five voices signed. The court listens. But they do not yet believe.*

> *Will you be ready if they say yes?*

---

Idran stood in silence, staring at the ocean.

His ships were ready.

His court was stirring.

He had names. Support. A network that was no longer just hope—but structure.

He turned to Raka and said,

> “Begin the assembly. I need my generals.”

---

He also gave new orders:

A neutral harbor was to be prepared.

And at its center, a pavilion.

Not a palace.

A **threshold**.

In the royal workshop, Idran commissioned something quiet and extraordinary:

A ceremonial tunic, stitched not with gold—

But with red thread.

One strand.

Looped into a pattern only one woman would understand.
