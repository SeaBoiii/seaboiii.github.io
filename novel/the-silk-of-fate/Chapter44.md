## **Chapter 44 – The Court Holds Its Breath** *(Lianhua’s POV)*

The scroll was thick. The ink, fresh. The wax seal bore the Dowager’s mark.

It meant permission.

Lianhua would be allowed to present her proposal—**to the inner advisory court**.

Not as a daughter.
Not as a bride.

But as a **diplomat**.

---

She prepared as she had never prepared before.

Not with rhetoric.

But with facts. Precedent. Poetry turned into policy.

And her final line:

> “Let our empires unite not through conquest—but through *choice.*”

---

The court was split.

Some whispered of betrayal. Others of brilliance.

The Dowager gave no public reaction.

Only a single command:

**“Let it go to vote.”**

---

In the garden, Yenli whispered:

“They’ve never voted on love before.”

To which Lianhua answered:

> “Then we’ve already changed something.”
