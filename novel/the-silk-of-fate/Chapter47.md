## Chapter 47 — The Shoreline He Builds *(Idran’s POV)*

The scroll arrived tucked inside a ledger of spice tariffs.

No wax seal. No imperial stamp. No official courier.

Just the faint scent of plum blossom tea on the paper—so subtle it could be mistaken for memory.

Idran warmed the page over a candle flame.

The hidden ink rose slowly, like dawn seeping into the edges of night.

> *The court has opened its hand.*
> *The tide is ready.*

He read it twice.

Then he let his eyes close—not in relief, not in triumph, but in something quieter.

Gratitude.

Not because the court had yielded.

But because **Lianhua had not.**

---

Outside his study, Tumapel breathed in its familiar rhythm—vendors calling by the market, roosters crowing too early, guards changing shifts with bored precision. The palace remained the palace. The walls remained the same.

But Idran felt different now.

The message wasn’t permission.

It was a signal.

A door had cracked open in Yuan.

And in Majapahit, he needed to make sure there was a landing on the other side.

Not a trap.

Not a cage disguised as sanctuary.

A **shoreline**.

---

Raka was already waiting when Idran stepped into the council room.

The merchant-turned-administrator sat with his elbows on the table, eyes sharp, ready to cut through ceremony.

“You received something,” Raka said.

Idran didn’t pretend otherwise.

“She’s moved the court,” he replied. “Now we move ours.”

Raka leaned back. “And how do you plan to do that without someone stabbing you in your sleep?”

Idran’s smile was brief.

“By making it too late for them to stop.”

---

He began with logistics.

Not romance.

He ordered three things before the sun reached its peak:

1. **A neutral receiving pavilion** at Tuban—built not like a palace, but like a diplomatic threshold. Wide roof, open sides, space for two banners to hang side by side.

2. **A maritime delegation council**, composed not only of nobles, but of scholars, port leaders, and religious figures—so the reception would not be framed as one man’s desire, but a kingdom’s intention.

3. **A public trade charter**, drafted carefully, offering the Yuan court incentives: stable spice routes, shared shipbuilding knowledge, maritime safety guarantees—benefits that made cooperation *profitable*.

Because empires rarely moved for love.

But they moved for advantage.

And Idran was learning to speak both languages.

---

Later that evening, he met with Citra in her rice mill courtyard. The air smelled of husk and warm grain; workers moved like steady tides, their hands practiced, their backs bent.

Citra listened as Idran spoke of the possible diplomatic union.

She didn’t interrupt.

When he finished, she wiped her hands on her apron and said, “If she comes, will she be safe?”

Idran answered without hesitation.

“As safe as I can make her.”

Citra’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not what I asked.”

He held her gaze.

Then corrected himself.

“She will be honored. She will be listened to. She will not be treated like a prize delivered by sea.”

Citra nodded once.

“Good,” she said. “Because if your nobles forget that, the people won’t.”

---

That night, Idran walked alone along the coastline near Tuban.

The sea wind tugged at his robe. The sky was dark—stars scattered like spilled salt.

He stood where the pavilion would be built.

For now it was only sand and rock and the sound of waves beating the shore.

But Idran could already see it.

A canopy of red silk.

Two flags.

Two languages spoken without mockery.

Lianhua stepping onto land not with lowered eyes, not escorted like property—

But walking forward like someone the world had finally made room for.

His chest tightened.

Not with longing alone.

With fear.

Not of losing power.

But of failing her.

---

He returned to the palace and opened his journal.

He didn’t write poetry.

He wrote the truth.

> *If she crosses the ocean, it will not be to escape.*
> *It will be to stand.*
> *So I must build a place worthy of her standing beside me.*

He paused.

Then wrote beneath it, smaller:

> *And if the court demands proof that my love is not weakness—
> then let them see what love can build.*

---

A knock came at the door.

Basran entered quietly, posture stiff.

“My prince,” he said, “there are murmurs.”

Idran’s eyes didn’t lift from the page.

“Of course there are.”

“They say the Yuan court is considering a union. They say you’re preparing Tuban for a foreign arrival. They say—”

Basran hesitated.

Idran finally looked up.

“What do they say?”

Basran swallowed.

“They say you’re building a road for a woman.”

Idran’s gaze steadied.

“No,” he replied, calm as stone.

“I’m building a road for a kingdom that refuses to rot.”

---

He stood, closing the journal.

He walked to the window, looking out at the torchlights of the palace grounds.

And somewhere beyond that—beyond forests, beyond sea, beyond politics—

She was standing in her own storm.

He whispered into the night, not as a prince, but as a man whose heart had finally chosen its direction:

“Hold on.”

“Just a little longer.”
