## *The Silk of Fate*  
**Chapter 40 – The Fifth Voice**

The final name had always been the hardest.

**Chancellor Hu**, steward of the imperial treasury, master of decorum, and an unshakable believer in systems.

He was not cruel.

But he did not believe in exceptions.

Not even for princesses with graceful words and quiet fire.

Lianhua requested an audience through official channels.

She wore pale green—the color of scholars.

No perfume. No painted brows. No fan to hide behind.

She carried only one scroll.

---

His chamber was lined with ledgers and treaties, all perfectly stacked. Even his tea leaves were arranged in descending order of age.

He did not look up when she entered.

“Princess,” he said, still writing. “You must know, I do not entertain appeals without legal precedent.”

“There is precedent,” she said calmly. “You just don’t like where it leads.”

That made him pause.

---

She stepped forward.

Unfurled the scroll.

Laid it before him.

Inside: not a poem. Not a plea.

But a meticulous outline of what would happen if her marriage to General Wu proceeded *without her consent*:

> The weakening of young scholar loyalty.  
> Trade allies already aligned with progressive court figures turning hesitant.  
> A likely withdrawal of diplomatic cooperation from select southern coastal partners.  
> Growing resentment from women of noble houses, many of whom had begun quoting her essays aloud.

Not anger.

Just facts.

Laid like stones across a river.

---

Chancellor Hu read in silence.

Then said, “This is not a rebellion.”

“No,” she replied. “It’s a suggestion. Before it becomes one.”

---

He signed.

Without flourish.

Just ink and truth.

---

That night, the vote was cast.

Not loudly.

But with weight.

And by morning, word had spread:

**The betrothal ceremony would be delayed.**

Officially: for health.

Unofficially: because a princess had gathered more minds than the court expected.

Lianhua stood by the window of her chamber, fingers brushing the sill.

Yenli entered, breathless.

“They’re talking. Everywhere.”

“I know.”

“What now?”

Lianhua turned, her face calm.

> “Now I buy us time. And then… I make sure it’s enough.”
