## **Chapter 41 – A Kingdom Drawn in Ink** *(Idran’s POV)*

The scroll arrived with the morning shipments. It bore the usual crest of the Yuan trade delegation—nothing to raise suspicion. But Idran knew better than to judge by seals.

He unrolled the parchment slowly. It was a shipping manifest.
At first glance, tedious.

Then—there it was.

A correction marked on the sixth line: a scheduled delivery delayed “by health of house and rhythm of ceremony.”
Phrasing that meant nothing to most.

But to Idran, it was unmistakable:

**Lianhua had bought time.**

---

He closed his eyes and let the meaning settle.

The court had not silenced her. Not yet.

The tide was shifting.

He had promised her he would be standing when the wave came.

So he moved.

---

His first stop was the **northern council house**, where Raka met him with crossed arms and a skeptical glance.

“You’ve been quiet,” Raka said.

“I was waiting,” Idran replied. “Now I act.”

---

Within days, Idran met with **nine key figures**—local governors, trade guild leaders, scholars, and retired generals.

He made no lofty speeches.

He showed numbers.

Maps.

*Stability through cooperation. Prosperity through shared reform.*

Then he spoke the words that changed the air in the room:

> “I don’t seek the throne to wear a crown. I seek it to build something that outlives us.”

---

By the week's end, five of them had pledged their support.

The others were watching.

But watching with interest.

---

That night, Idran returned to his study and penned his reply.

Disguised as commentary on timber exports, the final lines read:

> *Your voice reached the ocean. My ships are ready.*
