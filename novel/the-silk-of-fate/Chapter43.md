## **Chapter 43 – A Court Built on Quiet Defiance** *(Shared POV)*

Across oceans, they wrote.

Not in declarations—but in **fragments**.

Lianhua sent a commentary on the Book of Changes.

Idran returned one with mirrored metaphors from the Quran.

Their meaning lay not in what was said, but in *what was reflected*.

---

Lianhua faked illness during a court inspection.

Yenli brought fevered herbs. An apothecary testified.

The betrothal date was pushed back *again*.

Behind the court’s back, Idran's messages continued arriving—smuggled in shipments of jasmine root and lacquered fans.

Each line sharpened a plan:

> **Not an escape. A proposal.**
> **Not to run. But to rewrite.**

---

In Dadu, Lianhua began drafting a document:

**“Proposal for a Diplomatic Union Between the Sovereign Courts of Tumapel and Yuan.”**

In Tumapel, Idran ordered the refitting of three state vessels—designed not for war, but **for reception.**

The titles were public.

Their *true* purpose was not.

Yet.
