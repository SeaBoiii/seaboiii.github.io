## Chapter 49 — The Vote of Nine Shadows *(Idran’s POV)*

The sea carried news faster than couriers.

Not in words—at first. In **silence**.

In the way merchants paused mid-bargain when Idran walked past. In the way Raka’s scribes suddenly stopped joking in the council room. In the way Basran’s men stood a little straighter at the palace gate, as if preparing for a storm they couldn’t name.

Then the scroll arrived.

Thin. Plain. Folded like a casual trade note.

But the ink beneath the ink told a different story.

Idran held it close to a flame.

The hidden message rose like a pulse.

> *I spoke. They listened. Be ready.*

He didn’t move for a long moment.

Then he exhaled slowly—like a man who had been holding his breath since the day he left Dadu.

“She did it,” he murmured.

Raka, standing across the room, didn’t ask who.

He only said, “Then we do ours.”

---

Idran convened the inner circle at dusk.

Not a formal court council—those were filled with men loyal to tradition and suspicious of any future that didn’t look like the past.

This meeting was smaller.

But heavier.

The room smelled of sandalwood and salt, the coastal air creeping in through the shutters.

Citra sat with her hands folded, calm as steel.

Basran stood near the door, eyes alert.

Raka leaned against a pillar, pretending he wasn’t anxious.

And three new faces had joined them:

* **Sheikh Zayd**, a soft-spoken religious scholar known for preaching coexistence and justice.
* **Patih Damar**, a provincial administrator who had seen famine and blamed the court’s arrogance.
* **General Surya Wibawa**, retired but respected, with scars on his arms and patience in his gaze.

Idran laid a map on the table.

Not of territory.

Of **Tuban**.

The pavilion site circled in ink.

The harbor routes.

The guest housing areas.

The placement of banners.

Every detail mattered.

Because if Lianhua crossed the sea under the court’s gaze, then *every misstep would be used to prove she should have stayed caged.*

---

“They will vote,” Idran said quietly, voice steady. “And whatever they decide will shape the next year of our lives.”

Raka scoffed. “Only a year?”

Idran looked at him.

“A lifetime,” Raka corrected, raising both hands in surrender.

Idran didn’t smile.

Not yet.

He turned to Sheikh Zayd.

“If she comes as ambassador—if they allow even a cautious approval—Majapahit must show it is not barbaric. Not divided. Not hostile.”

Sheikh Zayd nodded. “Then your people must see her as a blessing, not a threat.”

“And my nobles?” Idran asked.

General Surya answered instead, voice low.

“Your nobles will see whatever benefits them. Make it beneficial to respect her.”

Idran’s jaw tightened slightly.

“Respect shouldn’t need incentives.”

“No,” Surya said. “But peace often does.”

---

That night, Idran walked out alone.

Not to the observatory.

To the shoreline.

The pavilion’s foundation had begun to rise—wooden posts planted into sand, ropes tied, canvas ready to be stretched.

He stood there as waves foamed at his feet.

And for a moment, he let himself imagine it:

A fleet on the horizon.

Red silk fluttering.

Her silhouette emerging against the sky.

Not as a shadow behind a screen.

But in full daylight.

Free enough to be watched without being owned.

His chest tightened.

Not with anticipation.

With fear.

Not of rejection.

But of **what he would become if the vote failed.**

---

Back in the palace, Basran approached him quietly.

“My prince,” he said. “There is something else.”

Idran turned. “Speak.”

Basran hesitated. “Your father has been meeting with the High Priest again.”

Idran felt the words land like wet ash.

“And?”

“They speak about succession,” Basran said. “About the risk of foreign influence. About how ‘faith imported by merchants’ has begun making noble sons… disobedient.”

Idran’s gaze sharpened.

“So the court tightens.”

“Yes.”

Idran stared back toward the sea.

Then said, softly, “Then we become iron beneath silk.”

---

Three nights later, another scroll arrived—this one longer, heavier, sent through safer hands.

Raka placed it on Idran’s desk without speaking.

Idran warmed the paper over flame.

And the hidden ink rose—line by line—until the message formed:

> *The vote is scheduled.*
> *Nine voices hold the court’s breath.*

Idran’s fingers curled around the parchment, careful not to tear it.

Nine shadows.

Nine minds in a room deciding whether Lianhua was allowed to choose her life.

Whether Idran was allowed to receive her without war.

Whether love could pass as diplomacy.

Whether a red thread could hold against empire.

---

He closed his eyes.

Then he knelt.

Not because he had to.

Because it was the only posture that felt honest.

He whispered a prayer into the quiet:

“Ya Allah…”

“Let them choose wisdom.”

“Let her be protected.”

“And if they deny her…”

His breath caught slightly.

“…then give me the strength to build a path anyway.”

---

When he rose, he didn’t feel peace.

But he felt ready.

And as dawn crept over Tuban’s horizon, Idran stood at the window and watched the sea like it might already be carrying her fate toward him.
