## Chapter 48 — The Proposal That Cuts Like Silk *(Lianhua’s POV)*

The court chamber was colder than it looked.

Gold warmed the eyes—lamps, carved dragons, lacquered pillars—but the air itself carried the chill of judgment. Lianhua felt it the moment she stepped past the threshold: the weight of men who had already decided what a woman should be allowed to want.

She bowed.

Not too low.

Not too proud.

Just enough to remind them she understood the ritual—while refusing to let it swallow her whole.

On the raised dais, the Emperor’s advisors sat in a crescent. Along the edges, scribes waited with inkstones, poised to trap every syllable into record.

The Empress Dowager sat slightly behind the Emperor’s screen, not directly visible, but unmistakably present.

Lianhua could sense her the way one senses the moon behind clouds.

Watching.

Measuring.

Waiting to see if she would bend.

---

The Chancellor’s voice broke the silence.

“Princess Lianhua,” he said, “you have petitioned for an unprecedented motion. Speak clearly. Speak briefly.”

A brief smile touched Lianhua’s lips.

“Briefly,” she repeated. “As if empire can be reduced to a few lines.”

The Chancellor’s eyes narrowed.

Lianhua did not linger there.

She stepped forward and placed a scroll on the low table at the center—thicker than any poem, heavier than any love letter.

“This,” she said, “is my proposal.”

She held her gaze steady as she spoke the opening line—carefully crafted, deliberately neutral.

“I request formal recognition as an **ambassador of goodwill**, empowered to represent the Yuan court in a diplomatic union with Tumapel—one founded on cooperation, trade stability, and scholarly exchange.”

A murmur moved through the chamber.

Not outrage.

Interest.

Because she hadn’t said “marriage” first.

She had said **policy**.

---

An advisor with a long moustache leaned forward.

“A woman as ambassador?”

Lianhua turned slightly.

“A woman as voice,” she corrected. “We have never lacked women with minds in this court. Only permission.”

The moustached advisor scoffed. “This is—bold.”

“Boldness is often just honesty spoken aloud,” she replied, voice calm.

She continued before they could frame her.

“The union I propose is not a treaty of conquest. Not tribute. Not annexation.”

She paused, letting the words settle.

“It is a **marriage of empires, not of property.**”

That line landed like a blade wrapped in silk.

A cut you didn’t feel until you saw the blood.

---

“Prince Idran is not the heir of Tumapel,” another advisor said quickly, eager to regain control. “Why should Yuan dignify a match with a second son?”

Lianhua’s eyes flickered—not in flinch, but in calculation.

“Because second sons are often the ones who learned how to listen.”

A ripple of restrained laughter. Not many dared. But it happened.

Lianhua kept her voice steady.

“And because he is not asking for Yuan to kneel. He is offering Yuan to stand beside him.”

---

The Chancellor’s voice was sharp now.

“You speak as if you know his intentions.”

“I do,” she said.

“Because you correspond?”

Silence.

The trap set itself.

Lianhua did not run.

“I have exchanged letters,” she admitted, “through legal channels of scholarly exchange and maritime trade commentary.”

An advisor snapped, “That is inappropriate—”

“No,” Lianhua interrupted softly, and the room stilled, startled by the firmness beneath her gentleness.

“It is **strategic.** The Yuan Dynasty thrives because it understands the world beyond its walls. It trades. It learns. It adapts.”

Her gaze swept the crescent of faces.

“You are not afraid of my correspondence.”

Her voice dropped slightly.

“You are afraid that I have been capable of it all along.”

---

A tense quiet filled the chamber.

Lianhua could feel her heartbeat—but it did not control her.

She continued, laying out what she knew they valued most.

Trade security along coastal routes.

Shared shipbuilding and navigation knowledge.

Formal exchange of scholars—Chinese philosophy in Majapahit libraries, Javanese maritime expertise in Yuan academies.

A reduction of pirate conflicts through a mutual protection clause.

She spoke their language: advantage, stability, strength.

Then—only then—did she speak the truth beneath all of it.

“The seas between us have always been treated as distance,” she said.

“But distance can also be a bridge.”

She lifted her chin.

“This union would make the Yuan Dynasty not smaller—but wider.”

---

The Emperor’s voice finally emerged from behind the screen.

Low. Controlled. Final.

“Princess Lianhua.”

“Yes, Your Majesty.”

“You ask for a change in tradition.”

“I ask for the empire to lead, not follow.”

A pause.

A long one.

The kind that felt like a rope pulled taut.

“Do you understand what you risk?”

Lianhua’s fingers curled lightly into her sleeve.

She thought of Idran standing on a shoreline he was building, brick by brick, without knowing if she would ever reach it.

She thought of her own name—Jun Cao—hidden reed, bending but not breaking.

She thought of the ribbon.

Then she answered with quiet clarity:

“I risk what I already lose if I obey.”

---

The chamber went still.

No one spoke.

And somewhere behind the screen, the Empress Dowager—silent as ever—let out a slow, almost imperceptible breath.

Lianhua felt it.

A sign.

Not approval.

Not yet.

But recognition.

---

The Chancellor cleared his throat.

“This proposal will be reviewed,” he said. “It will be… considered.”

The words were careful. Diplomatic.

But Lianhua knew what had truly happened.

They hadn’t dismissed her.

They hadn’t laughed her out of the room.

They had been forced to do the one thing the court hated most:

**Take her seriously.**

---

As she exited, she kept her pace steady.

Not hurried.

Not triumphant.

Just composed.

Only when she turned the corner into the quiet corridor did Yenli rush to her side, eyes wide.

“How was it?” Yenli whispered.

Lianhua’s lips curved—small, restrained, but real.

“I cut them,” she murmured.

“With silk.”

---

That night, Lianhua returned to her chamber and wrote a single line into a scroll meant for Tumapel.

No poetry.

No metaphor.

Just truth.

> *I spoke. They listened. Be ready.*

She sealed it.

Then sat by the window until the candle burned low.

Outside, the palace slept.

Inside, Lianhua’s heart stayed awake—steady, unafraid.

Because for the first time, her fate wasn’t being written for her.

She had taken the brush.
